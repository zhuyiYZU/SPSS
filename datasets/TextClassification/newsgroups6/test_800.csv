X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab space newline) and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below) Xentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below) Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X	Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces though it is not a X    requirement.  Also if possible try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname:	your name Xorg:	School/Company/Organization Xaddr:	postal address X	use tab indented lines to continue X	don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X	  It is suggested but not required that the title should X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X	* With the exception of the header all text outside of the above X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X	  something put it in the ---remark--- section or send a separate X	  Email message to the judges. X X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X	* To credit multiple authors include an ---author--- section for X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line and X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X	* The entry's remarks should include: X	    - what this program does X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input) X	    - special compile or execution instructions if any X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X	    - information about any ---data--- files X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They X	  should not be required to exist. X X	  If your entry does not need an info file skip the ---info--- X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files use multiple X	  ---info--- sections one per info file.  You should describe X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner it will be modified as follows: X X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile and 'build' is removed X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title followed by an optional X	       digit followed by '.c' X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X	       title possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title possibly followed X       by a digit followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted as long as it does not X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X		...!{applepyramidsunuunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X		obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted however. X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC. X X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry X       must be sent in a separate Email letter. X X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed. X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed. X X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid setgid super-user X       special owner or group) are not allowed. X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

XAll Rights Reserved.  Permission for personal education or non-profit use is Xgranted provided this this copyright and notice are included in its entirety Xand remains unaltered.  All other uses must receive prior permission in writing Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel. X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types variable number of arguments C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all or in most tests.  In certain X    cases a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand given X    two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake would save the above entry.  And sometimes X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C such as K&R C you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)[string];   <--- use string[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h> use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define #if #ifdef ...) X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#' many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason we look for X    programs that are compact and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point) because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob X    of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program we tend to favor the second version.  Of course a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest' lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a libXaw.a libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif Xv*ew or OpenL*ok toolkits since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5 and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier) so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format X    in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases X	where this program differs from the contest rules the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient however X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	n Xtitle:	chonglab Xentry:	0 Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:	Un*x v6 pdp11/45 X	2.9BSD pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition X    we use the name of the entry's title followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on or requires that your build source X    and/or binary files be a particular name please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary X X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source X		cp prog.c special_src.c X		cc special_src.c -o special_name X X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build X		tail +4 build > special_build X		sh < special_build X X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed or moved into a sub-directory say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something put it in the X    ---remark--- section or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{applepyramidsunuunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u +%a %h %d %T 19%y X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files and shred all related paper.  By tradition we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s) if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them if necessary. X X    In the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out X    by a similar but slightly better entry.  For this reason it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes of course X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not we select a small entry (usually one line) a X    strange/creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources X X    In addition pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books (The New Hackers Dictionary) and on T-Shirts. X X    Last but not least winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X	...!{applepyramidsunuunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.

What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 0.  Xt Glossary ---------------------------------------------------------------------- o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object RectObj Core Composite Constraint Shell OverrideShell WMShell etc.  The terms Xt and Intrinsics are used interchangeably however they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X window system.  In particular it does not include the Athena Motif OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the Intrinsics are not especially useful. o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The precise use is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the Object class although these are more accurately called windowless widgets or gadgets. o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib functions because Xt provides most such services although an understanding of Xlib helps with problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In brief Xlib Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set dangling pointers in the middle of a list traversal etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions. The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called.  Another option is to open a pipe tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up. Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so. Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  How do I use a different visual than the default? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual colormap and border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is not properly set a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used. How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information. /* * Some sample code to start up an application using something other * than the default visual. * * To compile: *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm * * To run: *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow * * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap * to install. */ #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h> typedef struct { Visual	*visual; int	depth; } OptionsRec; OptionsRec	Options; XtResource resources[] = { {visual Visual XtRVisual sizeof (Visual *) XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec visual) XtRImmediate NULL} {depth Depth XtRInt sizeof (int) XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec depth) XtRImmediate NULL} }; XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = { {-visual *visual XrmoptionSepArg NULL} {-depth *depth XrmoptionSepArg NULL} }; int main (argc argv) int		argc; char		**argv; { XtAppContext	app;		/* the application context */ Widget		top;		/* toplevel widget */ Display		*dpy;		/* display */ char		**xargv;	/* saved argument vector */ int		xargc;		/* saved argument count */ Colormap	colormap;	/* created colormap */ XVisualInfo	vinfo;		/* template for find visual */ XVisualInfo	*vinfo_list;	/* returned list of visuals */ int		count;		/* number of matchs (only 1?) */ Arg		args[10]; Cardinal	cnt; char		*name = test; char		*class = Test; /* * save the command line arguments */ xargc = argc; xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *)); bcopy ((char *) argv (char *) xargv argc * sizeof (char *)); /* * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can * retrieve the appropriate visual resource. */ cnt = 0; top = XtAppInitialize (&app class Desc XtNumber (Desc) &argc argv (String *) NULL args cnt); dpy = XtDisplay (top); cnt = 0; XtGetApplicationResources (top &Options resources XtNumber (resources) args cnt); cnt = 0; if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top))) { XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNvisual Options.visual); ++cnt; /* * Now we create an appropriate colormap.  We could * use a default colormap based on the class of the * visual; we could examine some property on the * rootwindow to find the right colormap; we could * do all sorts of things... */ colormap = XCreateColormap (dpy RootWindowOfScreen (XtScreen (top)) Options.visual AllocNone); XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNcolormap colormap); ++cnt; /* * Now find some information about the visual. */ vinfo.visualid = XVisualIDFromVisual (Options.visual); vinfo_list = XGetVisualInfo (dpy VisualIDMask &vinfo &count); if (vinfo_list && count > 0) { XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNdepth vinfo_list[0].depth); ++cnt; XFree ((XPointer) vinfo_list); } } XtDestroyWidget (top); /* * Now create the real toplevel widget. */ XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNargv xargv); ++cnt; XtSetArg (args[cnt] XtNargc xargc); ++cnt; top = XtAppCreateShell ((char *) NULL class applicationShellWidgetClass dpy args cnt); /* * Display the application and loop handling all events. */ XtRealizeWidget (top); XtAppMainLoop (app); return (0); } ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5.  Which visual should an application use? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such). Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome. As an example on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome 256 entry colormap static gray static color and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above plus 12 bit TrueColor 24 bit TrueColor an Overlay Plane. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell. A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.  Which visual depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen() DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree. If the parent of the widget is not null then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- See section 2.8 of the Xt specification. It eventually does get destroyed just not immediately.  The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the me

1,Hi I'm trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine and I'm observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a DrawingArea. Namely some Xlib operations work and some do not. In particular the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by some XDrawPoint calls and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the rightward direction over the drawing area but after the move is still on some part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when the pulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction. Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd is this a server bug? Thanks Zack T. Smith

1,I'm writing 'xwall' a simple X version of 'wall' and I want it to put a message up on each of a default list of displays.  The problem is that XOpenDisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently controlled by xdm (login screen).   I've been through the manuals and FAQ and don't see a simple way to see if a display is 'openable' ahead of time or to get XOpenDisplay to fail after a short period of time.

1,I have looked through the FAQ sections and have not seen a answer for this. I have an X/Motif application that I have written. I have a couple of gif files (or pict) that I have scanned in with a color scanner.  Now I would like to be able to convert the gif files into a format that could be read into my application and displayed on the background of its main window. Preferably with pixmaps or perhaps as an XImage. I have found functions in the pbmplus program suite to convert gif to xbm but that is monochrome and I really do need color. I have looked at xv which reads in gif and writes out several formats but have not found a way to write out a file which can be read in as a pixmap. Is there an easy way to do this? email responses preferred. thanks!

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->		      | X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types variable number of arguments C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all or in most tests.  In certain X    cases a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand given X    two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abus
1,We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines.  Also some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of groups.  Sorry for the cross posting. Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines. (See the diff marks at the right hand edge)  The rules and guidelines for this year remain the same so people who have already or are in the process of submitting entries for the 1993 IOCCC need not worry about these changes. chongo <Landon Curt Noll> /\cc/\        chongo@toad.com Larry Bassel                            lab@sun.com =-= #!/bin/sh # This is part 02 of a multipart archive # ============= mkentry.c ============== echo x - extracting mkentry.c (Text) sed 's/^X//' << 'SHAR_EOF' > mkentry.c && X/* @(#)mkentry.c	1.25 4/5/93 15:58:08 */ X/* X * Copyright (c) Landon Curt Noll & Larry Bassel 1993.

I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets perhaps even 100% faster.  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets were no longer any benefit to performance and that it's just as well to use widgets everywhere.  So why would ~50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph?  Should I start putting gadgets back into my long pulldown menus? XmGraph manages children connected by XmArc widgets in a directed network type graph with automatic layout capability.

I have been building X11 with gcc since 2.1 and the only time I had trouble was when the position independant code option broke (so I couldn't use gcc to build Sun shared libraries). The important thing to do is to follow the tips given in the gcc release. Gcc generates code that requires libgcc2 and you should take that into account when deciding which compiler to use for the libraries. -- Michael Salmon #include	<standard.disclaimer> #include	<witty.saying> #include	<fancy.pseudo.graphics> Ericsson Telecom AB Stockholm
1,Hi I am about to write an application in X/Motif that will require the embedding of a pseudo tty. So before I re-invent the wheel has anyone written/gotten a motif widget that does the job ? Otherwise I would appreciate any pointers to make such a beast. My environment is X11R4/Motif 1.1 and X11R5/Motif 1.2 (if this helps). Thanks in advance. Arthur Lim Email : arthur@mailhost.scs.com.sg
1,I need to have PCs and SPARCstations run the same application ( namely MicroSoft Project ). The original system ran on the PC. Now it needs to be expanded to allow UNIX users to work with the application. The current proposal is to use DESQview/X as a display server for the application. I would like to know your experiences with using DESQview/X to run an application on a PC and displaying on a SPARCstation. I've heard that the network traffic is slow. Replies only by e-mail please.

It's my understanding that the next release of UIM/X due out last February :-) has full support for C++. I use XDesigner which does not have the interpreter or UI meta languages of these other tools but does fully support C++ code generation reusable templates via C++ classes which are generated a variety of other handy features for using C++ and layout functions in different ways and generates Motif 1.2 code (including drag 'n drop internationalization etc.).  Fits in quite nicely with Doug Young's paradigm for C++/Motif. Available in the US from VI Corp in Europe from Imperial Software London (see FAQ for details).

1,You are right in supposing that the problem is with the XmNcolormap (XtNcolormap for truly literate beings) not being set.  What you want to do is start your application with your new colormap.  This can be a chicken and egg sort of problem however.  If you look at the Xt FAQ there is an example that should show how it can be done.  If not let me know and maybe I can improve the example. --pete -- Pete Ware					ware@cis.ohio-state.edu CIS Dept Ohio State University			w/ (614) 292-7318 228 Bolz Hall 2036 Neil Ave.			h/ (614) 538-0965 Columbus OH 43210

Please reply via e-mail. They aren't functions they are character arrays. The standard strings are either defined as string constants or character pointers into XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES. Your libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it undefined so simply recompile one or the other. It is probably worth adding -DXTSTRINGDEFINES to your CFLAGS. -- Michael Salmon #include	<standard.disclaimer> #include	<witty.saying> #include	<fancy.pseudo.graphics> Ericsson Telecom AB Stockholm
1,I have a program produces a continuous tone by calling XBell repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. If it is run more than once on a display the tones are buffered in the X server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program have exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this e.g. by emptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits? - Disclaimer: Please note that the above is a personal view and should not be construed as an official comment from the JET project.

The ability to program was >an entry requirement. At Robert Gordon University programming was the main (most time-consuming) start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects: Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX) Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 assembler) Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog) Mathematics/Statistics and Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea). The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors). The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2) Software Engineering (C/8086 assembler) Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly). In the first four years there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year this was reduced to a 30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this? BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by Honours year. Also every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-).

The latest freely-available XGKS can be obtained from xgks-request@unidata.ucar.edu; this is a 2c implementation derived from the X11R4 contrib XGKS from IBM and the University of Illinois. The release is on unidata.ucar.edu [128.117.140.3] as pub/xgks.tar.Z. [12/90] In addition Grafpak-GKS is available from Advanced Technology Center (714-583-9119). GKSUL is available from gks@ulowell.edu (ULowell CS department). It is a 2b implementation which includes drivers for a variety of devices. It can be passed an X window ID to use. The package includes both C and Fortran bindings. [11/90; from dsrand@mitre.org and from stew@hanauma.stanford.edu] An XgksWidget is produced by Neil Bowers (neilb@leeds.dcs; neilb@dcs.leeds.ac.uk); the latest [10/91] conforms with the new version of XGKS (2.4). It is available on export in contrib/xgks-widget.tar.Z. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  85)  Where can I get an X-based PEX package? The first official release of PEX is with X11R5; fix-22 brings the Sample Implementation server to version 5.1. The final PEX 5.1 Protocol specification is now available via anonymous ftp to export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) in the directory /pub/DOCS/PEX/. Changes made from the Public Review draft are listed in the file 5.1P_changes in that directory. [9/92] The final PEXlib 5.1 document is on export in pub/DOCS/PEXlib.

The file pub/uipex/uipex.tar.Z is on a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1); the porting platform was an RT running 4.3.  Questions and comments can to go uipex@cs.uiuc.edu. In addition the PEXt toolkit by Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com) is available on export as PEXt.tar.Z; it includes a PEX widget making it easier to include PEX in Xt-based programs. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  86)  Where can I get an X-based TeX or DVI previewer? The xtex previewer for TeX files is available from a number of archive sites including uunet; the current version is usually on ftp.cs.colorado.edu (128.138.204.31) in SeeTeX-2.18.5.tar.Z; pre-converted fonts are also on that machine. The distribution all includes mftobdf which converts PK GF and PXL fonts to BDF format where they can then be compiled for use by your local X server. The xdvi dvi-previewer is fairly comprehensive and easy to use. It is also available from a number of sites including uunet and export.lcs.mit.edu; current version is patchlevel 16 [12/92]. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  87)  Where can I get an X-based troff previewer? X11R4 has two previewers for device-independent troff: the supported client xditview and the contributed-but-well-maintained xtroff. An earlier version of xtroff also appeared on the R3 contributed source. xditview is also in the R5 distribution. In addition the xman client can be used to preview troff documents which use the -man macros (i.e. man pages). If psroff is used its output can be viewed with a PostScript previewer. In addition: xproof an X previewer for ditroff has been contributed by Marvin Solomon (solomon@cs.wisc.edu); version 3.5 is available on export in contrib/xproof*. 	[8/90] Elan Computer Group (CA: 415-964-2200) produces eroff a modified troff implementation and Elan/Express an X11 eroff previewer. SoftQuad (416-963-8337; USA only 800-387-2777 mail@sq.uu.net or mail@sq.com) offers SoftQuad Publishing Software including a substantially- rewritten troff formatter a better intermediate language with backwards compatibility and an X11[R3R4] previewer. (This is the package adopted by AT&T's own MIS department and used in and re-sold by many parts of AT&T). [information from Ian Darwin SoftQuad (ian@sq.com) 3/90] Image Network (1-800-TOXROFF; CA: 415-967-0542) offers the Xroff package which includes a fine modified troff implementation and a set of X11-based page previewers. (This is the package OEM'ed by several hardware vendors.)

A new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README: This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates Wc - Widget Creation resource files and this distribution also includes the Widget Creation Library (version 1.06 with the exception of the demos and Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth. Check dirt.README dirt.A2.0.tar.Z and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu. The InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175). Quest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an interactive building tool. Druid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components for which it generates C/UIL code. Info: Singh G Kok CH Ngan TY Druid: A System for Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development. Proc. ACM SIGGRAPH Symp on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST'90). ACM NY 1990 pp:167-177.

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered the specification does not guarantee such a sequence and supplemental authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is undefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution. In general the callback procedures should be thought of as operating independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed then the single callback to be registered can explicitly call other functions necessary. [4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget? XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt? It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a yes answer the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: void quit(Widget w XtPointer client XtPointer call) { int             answer; answer = AskUser(w Really Quit?); if (RET_YES == answer) { answer = AskUser(w Are You Really Positive?); if (RET_YES == answer) exit(0); } } A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it. This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this where the Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for OK Cancel and Help or equivalents: int AskUser(w string) Widget          w; char           *string; { int             answer=RET_NONE;	/* some not-used marker */ Widget          dialog;			/* could cache&carry but ...*/ Arg             args[3]; int             n = 0; XtAppContext    context; n=0; XtSetArg(args[n] XmNmessageString XmStringCreateLtoR(string XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++; XtSetArg(args[n] XmNdialogStyle XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++; dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w) string args n); XtAddCallback(dialog XmNokCallback response &answer); XtAddCallback(dialog XmNcancelCallback response &answer); XtAddCallback(dialog XmNhelpCallback response &answer); XtManageChild(dialog); context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w); while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) { XtAppProcessEvent (context XtIMAll); } XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */ return answer; } The dialog supports three buttons which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices: void response(w client call) Widget          w; XtPointer client; XtPointer call; { int *answer = (int *) client; XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call; switch (reason->reason) { case XmCR_OK: *answer = RET_YES;	/* some #define value */ break; case XmCR_CANCEL: *answer = RET_NO; break; case XmCR_HELP: *answer = RET_HELP; break; default: return; } } and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there. [Thanks to Dan Heller (argv@sun.com); further code is in Dan's R3/contrib WidgetWrap library. 2/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 124)  How do I determine the name of an existing widget? I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is. Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function which will work on both widgets and non-widget objects. If you are still using R3 you can use this simple bit of code to do what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt including R4. #include <X11/CoreP.h> #include <X11/Xresource.h> String XtName (widget) Widget widget;	/* WILL work with non-widget objects */ { return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name); } [7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers (larry@boris.webo.dg.com) 9/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)? I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program: > canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...widgetClass...) /* drawing area */ > ... > window = XtWindow(canvas);	/* get the window associated with the widget */ > ... > XDrawLine (...window...);	/* produces error */ The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL (no window) could create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() before attempting to use the window associated with a widget. Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet so you should also wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage? The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it you can take the following steps to avoid the error: 1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events the copy wasn't clean and the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you the parts of the pixmap which aren't good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory. [10/92; thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com)] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 127)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X? A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server: display = XOpenDisplay(display_name); if (display) { do X stuff } else { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display by convention or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY if set]. This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment neither of which is adequate. [5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 128)  How do I make a busy cursor while my application is computing? Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application? The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window so it won't affect any other application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop.) Substitute toplevel with your top-most widget here (similar code should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window): unsigned long valuemask; XSetWindowAttributes attributes; /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */ valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor; attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask | ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask); attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel) XC_watch); /* The window will be as big as the display screen and clipped by its own parent window so we never have to worry about resizing */ XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel) XtWindow(toplevel) 0 0 65535 65535 (unsigned int) 0 0 InputOnly CopyFromParent valuemask &attributes); where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767. When you want to use this busy cursor map and raise this window; to go back to normal unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well. In addition note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor resource which can be temporarily reset should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events. [thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com) Dan Heller (argv@sun.com) and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/905/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program? An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X connection to the display. What you need to do is fork; then immediately in the child process close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your exec. You will then be able to exit the parent. Alternatively before exec'ing make this call which causes the file descriptor to be closed on exec. (void) fcntl(ConnectionNumber(XDisplay) F_SETFD 1); [Thanks to Janet Anstett (anstettj@tramp.Colorado.EDU) Gordon Freedman (gjf00@duts.ccc.amdahl.com); 2/91. Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com) 3/93.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler? No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which might be while the function you are calling is already executing) it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions. You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added. Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error. [Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU) 5/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 131)  What are these Xlib sequence lost errors? You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error handler or more likely if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or Xlib from a signal handler which you shouldn't be doing in any case. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket

There is no event mask for a particular mouse button press. However in your event handler you can use the event structure passed in and query it to find which button was pressed i.e. void SomeEventHandler(Widget w XtPointer data XEvent *event) { /* Catch the button 1 (usually left button) */ if ( event->xbutton.button == Button1 ) { /* do some action */ } else { /* do nothing and exit from function */ } } -- -Guy Singh                 IXI            Internet: guy@x.co.uk Vision Park    UUCP:     guy@ixi.uucp Cambridge      Bang:     ...!uunet!ixi!guy CB4 4ZR UK    Tel:      +44 223 236 555

Build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels you name opaque are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. Use this bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for XCopyArea() and remember to adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the XCopyArea() blit origin.

No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a little dislocation you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the icon first blitted because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it is masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all not to be merged are 0. Then set the clip_mask of the gc to this bitmap set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable use GXCopy and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+

1,Archive-name: x-faq/part2 Last-modified: 1993/04/04 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  24)! How do I make a screendump or print my application? The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command: csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.] Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2 available on export [8/92] is the most recent. xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z. A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu. xprint by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z. To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools you can use xpr which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output. The XV program can grab a portion of the X display manipulate it and save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities. Also: Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter 2.0 an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter. ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility image-processing and support for PostScript and non-PostScript printers. Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) include session managers or other desktop programs which include print portion of screen or take a snapshot options. Some platforms also have tools which can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems for example have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer. Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct support for printing xwd files but you'll typically need some other package to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display? If you need color PostScript in particular you can - grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color PostScript such as xgrabsc and xv - grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS. You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this as is the Xim package. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor? This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider instead a system-dependent mechanism for e.g.  capturing the frame-buffer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X? The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ Portable Bitmap Toolkit which includes a number of programs for converting among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps gray-scale images and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently; the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z. Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in particular) which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary. It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22). Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are later versions available including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export. Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93. xv (X Image Viewer) written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley) can read and display pictures in Sun Raster PGM PBM PPM X11 bitmap TIFF GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust color intensity contrast aspect ratio crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display manipulate on it and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu. The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>. Conversion and manipulation package similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z. The Img Software Set by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu> reads and writes its own image format displays on an X11 screen and does some image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z along with large collection of color images. The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-* weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-* and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*. Xim The X Image Manipulator by Philip Thompson does essential interactive displaying editing filtering and converting of images. There is a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif xwd xbm tiff rle xim (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications. ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats (PPM TIFF GIF SUN Raster etc) are included. xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com10/90] xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions. A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91;5/92] [some material from Larry Carroll (larryc@poe.jpl.nasa.gov) 5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  28)  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window? The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar. A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell: echo ESC]2;TEXT^G where ESC is the escape key TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character). Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories: alias newcd 'cd \!*; echo -n ESC]2\;$cwd^G' The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name used in the icon use the digit '0' instead and use '1' to change only the icon name. Note: another way to do this which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell is to wrap the escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself. Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a ^V. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences? The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z. O'Reilly's Volume 3 the X User's Guide includes an R5 version of the control sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93 and a Motif version of the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences. [1/93] Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt a compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter). In a pinch a VT100 manual will do. [last updated 10/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm et al fail against the R4 server? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ? In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut you need to stty pass8 but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font such as XTerm*font: 	-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 XTerm*boldfont:	-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 [The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.] In addition you may want to set this in your shell: setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1 For a given character above 127 you can determine the key to use with the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using `man ascii`). For example o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') is Alt-'. [thanks to Greg Holmberg (greg%thirdi@uunet.uu.net) and Stephen Gildea (gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu); 6/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small? You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give a resource specification like this: xterm*geometry: 80x24 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24. For the main window this is OK as it uses characters for its size. But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry name it explicitly: xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection? You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. However a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for manipulating the selection will help; e.g. % xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties. A version is on export. Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z which can be adapted to do this. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources? You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH. Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose for example that you are running Sun's Open Windows and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located): setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()): %N      The value of the filename parameter or the application's class name. %T      The value of the file type.  In this case the literal string app-defaults %C      customization resource (R5 only) %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults. %L      Language locale and codeset (e.g. ja_JP.EUC) %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. ja) %t      The territory part of the display's language string %c      The codeset part of the display's language string Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is Myterm. Also
1,Hi I am trying to implement a pointer feature in Xlib I have multiple windows and all can take input and show output simultaneously on all other displays I want to implement a pointer feature I would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once I choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able to see it Can you give me some hints as to how I should proceed I am new to Xlib replies will be greatly appreciated Thank you Prakash < duvvuri@cs.odu.edu >
1,(please respond via email!) Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net. The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does (which makes no sense to me). The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So you can't actually edit any colors. We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around in the xcms code in Xlib but without some understanding of the theory I have no idea what's going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the above-mentioned programs work on their systems or let me know if they fail for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have. Any hints? Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this group.

1,Archive-name: x-faq/part3 Last-modified: 1993/04/04 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  58)! Where can I get patches to X11R5? The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup. Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in their source distributions of X11. People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has 23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line send fixes # where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch. Here are a few complications: 1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request 5a 5b 5c and 5d separately 2) the file sunGX.uu which was part of an earlier patch was re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris] 3) fix 8 is in two parts: 8a and 8b 4) fix 13 is in three parts: 13a 13b and 13c 5) fix 16 is in two parts: 16a and 16b 6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite which previously was optional 7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for PEXlib.uu.[1234]. 8) fix 22 is in 9 parts 22a through 22i ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive? The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail it a request and it mails back the response. Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything so you can have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). The xstuff server treats the Subject: header line just like any other line of the message. The archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories.  Each directory has an index and each subdirectory has an index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it. 1) The command help or send help causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file. 2) if your message contains a line whose first word is index then the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. For example you can say send index fixes (or index fixes). A message that requests an index cannot request data. 3) if your message contains a line whose first word is send then the xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name an item you give its directory and its name. For example send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9 You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the day's quota then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota it sends the requests out shortest-first. 4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses.  If you use such a mailer you won't get any response.  If you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu or path bar!foo!frotz in the body of your message and the daemon will use it. The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If your mailer deals in ! notation try sending to {someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

You can obtain either OSF/Motif source or binaries from a number of vendors. Motif 1.2.2 source is now available; it is based on X11R5. Motif 1.1 is based on the R4.18 Intrinsics and is currently [7/92] at 1.1.5. An OSF/Motif source license must be obtained from OSF before source can be obtained from the Open Software Foundation or any value-added vendor for any version. Call the Direct Channels Desk at OSF at 617-621-7300 for ordering information. Various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries header files and documentation; check your hardware vendor particularly if that vendor is an OSF member. In addition independent binary vendors produce Motif toolkits for machines for which Motif is not supported by a vendor; the kits include varied levels of bug-fixing and support for shared libraries and are based on widely divergent version of Motif: Quest (408-988-8880) sells kits for Suns as well; IXI (+44 223 462 131) offers kits for Sun3 and Sun4. NSL (+33 (1) 43 36 77 50; requests@nsl.fr) offers kits for the Sun 3 and Sun 4. Bluestone Consulting makes a kit for Sun systems. ICS (617-62-0060) makes several binary kits notably for Sun DEC. HP and DEC have announced support for Motif on Sun systems. Unipalm (+44-954-211-797) currently offers for Sun systems a Motif Development Kit including X11R4 and based on Motif 1.1.2.

It has also announced Motif 1.2 for Solaris systems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  62)  Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5? Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5. Motif 1.1 available in source form from OSF as of August 1990 uses the vanilla X11R4 Intrinsics where vanilla means with just a few patches; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches 15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18 though. Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with -DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5 although there are some known new geometry-management problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  63)  Where can I get toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK? Sun's XView has a SunView-style API. A version is on the X11R4 tape; the latest [2/92] 3.0 sources are on export in contrib/xview3/. XView and X binaries for the Sun 386i (roadrunner) are available for ftp from svin01.win.tue.nl (131.155.70.70) directory pub/X11R4_386i.

The ability to program was >an entry requirement. Try the 'M.Sc. Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University. It's a conversion course but at least they teach REAL programming. In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL Simula Prolog Miranda. Also some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well. They also did concurrent programming and operating systems some software engineering plus quite a few optional units including database theory and some stuff about comms. The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and X Windows programming as well) anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending on your tastes the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching. The one critiscism I would level at the course which I would have thought invaluable is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry - this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months) but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course. Yes I know this sounds like a plug for the course why not! Mackem Ian.

I suspect this is because VUE creates a window (probably OverrideRedirect) that is the size of (or larger than) the Root Window. Because the window manager does not know about this you cannot move resize etc. it. xv in the mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested but you never get to see it because VUE's window is overlaid on top of the root window.

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible service and value-added to our members.  Last year the SUG 1991 disk contained plug-and-play X11R4 20MB of additional essential binaries almost 200MB of Sun patches fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net postings priced at only $250. Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be produced inexpensively but to continue to supply as much value-added as possible.  To accomplish this we will be putting out a two disk set the first containing what's ready and needed now the second available later in '92 containing more SPARC binaries and other useful material not found on previous disks. The SUG 1992.1 disk which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce contains a lot of essential source code and we decided it would be a great service to make it available right away to our members (and this pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a SUG member you can become one for an additional $40 if you live within the US or $55 outside. The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used by PC Macintosh and other workstations as well) and contains a total of 543MB of material including: X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after the initial distribution thus four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0 distribution are included (109MB of material).

1,We have recently purchased a Tektronix xterminal and I'm having a problem with it. We have a graphics widget that we wrote to display waveforms and it doesn't work on the xterminal. the buttons etc all show up and it seems to take the 'right' amount of time to draw but nothing is visible in the graphics window. I have no clue as to where to start looking: the program works fine on all our suns (3s and 4s color and B&W). could anyone suggest a line of attack for this problem?

My beliefs opinions and expressions are strictly my own and do not represent or reflect any official or unofficial policies or attitudes of any other person or organization.... but.  I have heard that Ford Motor Company has (had) a recruiting bias toward engineers and away from computer science graduates.  The reasoning is supposedly to better meet long range personnel requirements.  This is evidenced by the large number of CS people who are employed via contracts and are not brought on board except in special circumstances.  This is a generalization which obviously doesn't always hold true but there are statistics.  Furthermore most software engineering at Ford gets done by electrical engineers.  I know of 2 univerities that have merged the computer science department and the electrical engineering so that you can get a computer degree which qualifies you for much more than programming. But since my beliefs and opinions are merely figments of my distorted imagination I suppose I should keep it to myself.

1,What I want to be able to do is to set the cursor color to the same as the forground color that is set for that xterm. From the man page..... -cr color This option specifies the color to use for text cur- sor.   The  default  is  to  use the same foreground  <--- color that is used for text.  <--- However this doesnt seem to be the case it appears to default to black or to whatever XTerm*cursorColor is set to. Feel free to point me at the relevant FM or whatever Cheers C
1,Can anybody tell me how to use the Xmu function XmuCvtStringToWidget. I want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that I can connect two widgets together on an XmForm. ie. MyProggy*MyListSW.topWidget:               MainTextSW However when I run the program I get the message: Warning: No type converter registered for 'String' to 'Window' conversion. (Just like the manual sez). I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way to go about this: static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs[] = { { XtWidgetBaseOffset (XtPointer)XtOffsetOf( CoreRec core.parent ) sizeof(CoreWidget) } }; XtSetTypeConverter( XtRString XtRWidget XmuCvtStringToWidget parentCvtArgs XtNumber(parentCvtArgs) XtCacheAll                                NULL ); However I haven't got a clue where to put it! The example code I have seems to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget; but elsewhere it says that I can add it to a widget's class_intialize function. HOW? What's one of those? :-( If anybody has any code to do this please let me know the trick - I'm sure this is a FAQ. Thanks in advance Rik.

1,I am trying to write an image display program that uses the MIT shared memory extension.  The shared memory segment gets allocated and attached to the process with no problem. But the program crashes at the first call to XShmPutImage with the following message: X Error of failed request:  BadShmSeg (invalid shared segment parameter) Major opcode of failed request:  133 (MIT-SHM) Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_ShmPutImage) Segment id in failed request 0x0 Serial number of failed request:  741 Current serial number in output stream:  742 Like I said I did error checking on all the calls to shmget and shmat that are necessary to create the shared memory segment as well as checking XShmAttach.  There are no problems. If anybody has had the same problem or has used MIT-SHM without having the same problem please let me know. By the way I am running OpenWindows 3.0 on a Sun Sparc2. Thanks in advance-- John C.

There's really no simple way to tell this is the case. You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool. You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources. Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit() regularly.

Hackers love CLs because >  ... What I like about GUI's: - The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects files text directories etc. and and manipulate them in some way such as delete copy paste rename ... - The ability to have several applications / screens visible and accessable at the same time. - Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use. If it has a GUI I can usually accomplish what I want to do fairly easily the command line on the other hand often is a long and painful experience. What I hate about GUI's: - Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a computer with one hand and use the other for holding something like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be done with one hand such as navigating cutting pasting searching opening and saving files etc. The main thing I need to use both hands for is entering text. I guess I need to get one of those mice with like 20 buttons or something and then I will have the best of both worlds. Brent
1,Hi I am in the process of making the decision whether I should write c++ wrappers for motif myself or use Motif++ or Interviews. Though I have downloaded the tar files I fail to see any documentation. I have two questions: 1) If you have used these or similar c++sy toolkits what has been your experience? 2) Where do I find reference books /documentation for them? any and all input will be greatly appreciated. /unmesh

1,Can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter-client communications BESIDES I.C.C.M.? I've looked everywhere I can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it but nobody SHOWS you how.  O'Reilly has no examples ICCM has no examples Asente & Swick give no examples - in fact most of the books I've looked at if they discuss ICC at all simply give a condensed version of the ICCM and then refer you to the ICCM.  I did find one example of how to use Atoms and Properties in Young's book and five hours after I bought Young's book I had my applications talking to each other. I am not sure however if thats the best way.  I'd like to stay independent of Unix so pipes and/or sockets probably aren't the way to go.  But within X one can also use messages the clipboard and perhaps window groups. I need a text that discusses the various methods discusses which method is best for which purpose and gives examples.  Without examples it's all just words. Thanks in advance Ross
1,Well I am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask but let me try anyway. I am running xterm and like all UNIX users I run man <something>. Recently I switched to Solaris 2.1 and their man pages are littered with .I directives that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm. The resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at. Back when I was using SunOS 4.1.2 I remember their man pages have some keywords displayed with underlining.... So my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under .I directives for nroff man pages to perhaps underlining or at least disabling it. (.B directives are fine I like them. And of course I don't want to go in and edit the man pages inputs...) Somehow xterm allows one to specify both a normal font and a bold font but not an italic font?? Any pointers suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks -- John P.S. Running xterm -rv won't work I tried...

These are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the performance of your workstation. Well more hardware isn't always an option and I wonder if more hardware is always even a necessity. This FAQ list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X Windows on your workstation WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE. Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts. This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation. However they are outside the scope of this document. [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system performance might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook System Performance Tuning by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the way through reading it and it looks like a well-written comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.] ----------------- Table of Contents ----------------- 0. Introduction & Administrivia 1. What about the Other X FAQ? 2. Window Managers 3.

Author & Notes ! = changed since last issue. * = new since last issue. ----------------------------- Introduction & Administrivia ----------------------------- This document is posted each month on or around the 15th to the Usenet news groups comp.windows.x news.answers and comp.answers. If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few months old (see the Last-modified date above) you should probably locate the latest edition since the information may be outdated. If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does not receive them and/or this article has already expired you can retrieve this FAQ from an archive site. There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about them and how to access them please see the Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup posting in news.answers.

If you do not have access to anonymous ftp you can retrieve it by sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the command send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups in the message body. ----------------------------- What about the Other X FAQ? ----------------------------- David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions document. Its focus is on general X information while this FAQ concentrates on performance. The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed but only with regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be: Use X11R5 it is faster than R4. (Please see the X FAQ for complete details). --------------- Window Managers --------------- There are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager. A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move. Also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ The X Server ------------ Which Server? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. If you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome X11 server. On my Monochrome Sun I haven't noticed much difference between the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ] How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system X should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler. You can expect to get *very* large speedups in the server by not using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market. Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock() function call but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try. [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com) Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my .xclients script to do this logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core though. This sounds crazy but I have confirmed that it works! Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of why this works which I have summarized here: When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU and more importantly memory.  If you put a sleep in there you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up. Similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts: toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this initialization is done (The process has reached a steady state) the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources This is most definitely a Your Mileage May Vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered: available RAM local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc. Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & I've experimented with: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 3; exec xterm ) & (sleep 4; exec xterm ) & I've even tried: (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ] All of these yielded fairly comparable results and so I just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity.  You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you'll get speed increases in load-up time. One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small one large one roman whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server.  This will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au) Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ] eg: My main xterm font is 7x13 so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since I don't normally use 8x13 I've eliminated one font from my server. Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): Keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs. If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts use a font server. About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) One suggestion: In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true Then separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH: setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N [ The comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.] So when xterm launches it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name. This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com) Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov) and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.] This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits: - Easier to maintain / more usable. - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn`t have to load all your resources. - Applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. It also has drawbacks: - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an application's resource database you just need to re-run the application without having to xrdb again. - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not. WATCH OUT FOR THIS!! I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file which cpp stripped out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file. The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy e.g. ``#ifdef COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management. - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For example neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults. - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .Xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that I seldom use. Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In that situation rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to <hostname>:0.0 where <hostname> is the name of your workstation you should set your DISPLAY variable to unix:0.0 or :0.0.  By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdah
1,Hello When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying cannot load app-defaults file... check your XAPPLRESDIR environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory ( this is the app-defaults file for BX ) in the directory specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable. If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly. To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all the users make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults depending on how your system is set up. Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX. For example let's say I've installed BX in /t then my system directory resource should be set like this : *systemDirectory: /t/builderXcessory Thanks ICS Tech Support

1,Archive-name: x-faq/speedups Last-modified: 1993/4/15 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF X -- monthly posting - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Compiled by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) More RAM Faster CPU's More disk space Faster Ethernet...  These are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the performance of your workstation. Well more hardware isn't always an option and I wonder if more hardware is always even a necessity. This FAQ list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X Windows on your workstation WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE. Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts. This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation. However they are outside the scope of this document. [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system performance might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook System Performance Tuning by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the way through reading it and it looks like a well-written comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.] ----------------- Table of Contents ----------------- 0. Introduction & Administrivia 1. What about the Other X FAQ? 2. Window Managers 3.

Author & Notes ! = changed since last issue. * = new since last issue. ----------------------------- Introduction & Administrivia ----------------------------- This document is posted each month on or around the 15th to the Usenet news groups comp.windows.x news.answers and comp.answers. If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few months old (see the Last-modified date above) you should probably locate the latest edition since the information may be outdated. If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does not receive them and/or this article has already expired you can retrieve this FAQ from an archive site. There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about them and how to access them please see the Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup posting in news.answers. The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If you do not have access to anonymous ftp you can retrieve it by sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the command send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups in the message body. ----------------------------- What about the Other X FAQ? ----------------------------- David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions document. Its focus is on general X information while this FAQ concentrates on performance. The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed but only with regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be: Use X11R5 it is faster than R4. (Please see the X FAQ for complete details). --------------- Window Managers --------------- There are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager. A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move. Also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ The X Server ------------ Which Server? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. If you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome X11 server. On my Monochrome Sun I haven't noticed much difference between the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ] How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system X should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler. You can expect to get *very* large speedups in the server by not using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market. Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock() function call but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try. [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com) Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my .xclients script to do this logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core though. This sounds crazy but I have confirmed that it works! Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of why this works which I have summarized here: When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU and more importantly memory.  If you put a sleep in there you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up. Similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts: toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this initialization is done (The process has reached a steady state) the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources This is most definitely a Your Mileage May Vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered: available RAM local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc. Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & I've experimented with: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 3; exec xterm ) & (sleep 4; exec xterm ) & I've even tried: (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ] All of these yielded fairly comparable results and so I just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity.  You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you'll get speed increases in load-up time. One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small one large one roman whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server.  This will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au) Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ] eg: My main xterm font is 7x13 so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since I don't normally use 8x13 I've eliminated one font from my server. Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): Keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs. If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts use a font server. About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) One suggestion: In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true Then separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH: setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N [ The comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.] So when xterm launches it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name. This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com) Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov) and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.] This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits: - Easier to maintain / more usable. - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn`t have to load all your resources. - Applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. It also has drawbacks: - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an application's resource database you just need to re-run the application without having to xrdb again. - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not. WATCH OUT FOR THIS!! I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file which cpp stripped out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file. The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy e.g. ``#ifdef COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management. - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For example neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults. - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .Xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that I seldom use. Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In that situation rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to <hostname>:0.0 where <hostname> is the name of your workstation you should set your DISPLAY variable to unix:0.0 or :0.0.  By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdah
1,Hello When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying cannot load app-defaults file... check your XAPPLRESDIR environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory ( this is the app-defaults file for BX ) in the directory specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable. If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly. To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all the users make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults depending on how your system is set up. Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX. For example let's say I've installed BX in /t then my system directory resource should be set like this : *systemDirectory: /t/builderXcessory Thanks ICS Tech Support

The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window Manager that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat similiar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent however its name is. But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif in fact MWM and Motif can work without each other and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason he switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications and this toolkit is IMHO uncomparable to MS-W because it is much more wellorganized and features alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface. You cannot say A Porsche looks like a VW K鋐er ONLY because they have the wheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete different worlds only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel at the same position as MS-W. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+

1,...let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and action-based and the other symbol-based. True but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model of what the GUI users are doing not about what they actually *are* doing. This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer* of the system. (NB: some users may see it too but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.) I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After all that's what I do too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models and they must ultimately serve the user of the system not the builder of the system. I don't recall the actual stats but something like 1 in 5 people can be categorized as a symbol manipulator. It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim. At any rate I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think like programmers. Bankers financial analysts structural engineers --- these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol manipulation. But what they do is not programming and programming is not required to do what they do. To restate my previous point: yes users want to build their own solutions; no they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.

On any font larger that 5x7 it messes up characters that are types the cursor seems to be too large or splits into a 1/2 reverse video 1/2 outline block (which changes when the pointer is moved into the window).  I am trying to use monospaced fonts (not -p- fonts).  Is there any way of changing the appearence of the block cursor is an Xterm?

1,I am creating a graphics program using the Athena widgets. I use Xlib routines to install a custom Graphics Contex by obtaining the display and window variables with the XtWindowOfObject() and XtDisplayOfObject(). The object was one of the sub widgets. The problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected the graphic contex reverts to the orginal one. I tried moving the allocation of the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing changed. I am preforming all of this manipulation before calling XtAppMainLoop().

I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++ WWL InterViews GINA++ and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the toolkits I mentioned but the resulting code looks little like Motif and I have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks promising but I haven't found a free version with Motif support and I'm not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like but which does not make sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task. At this point my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in C and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task.  Later if OSF or some credible standards-setting body comes up with a C++ interface to Motif I will change to that.  It does me no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only library I'd consider right now but in our environment we'd end up spending nearly $5000 to use it and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the J curve. - Brad -- Brad Daniels		`	|  If money can't buy happiness daniels@neosoft.com		|   I guess I'll have to rent it.

1,Hello Motif World a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif++. I got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail and I know of several people who have been using Motif++ and there are probably a number of people I am not aware of who are also using Motif++. My question is: How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list where people can ask questions about Motif++ swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project and this way I can make a list of priorities in what order things should be added or changed. If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list please take the time to reply to this message and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest say about 20 people or more a mailing-list will be set up at my site and I will post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups. -- Ronald van Loon     | In theory there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice. 3DCV Group Utrecht | The Netherlands     | In practice however there is.
1,Greetings I am using an X server that provides 3 visuals: PseudoColor 8 bit Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit. A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24). In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the section about XCteateWindow something like: In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the parent's be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used in the window attributes when creating or else a BadMatch occurs. This warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer editions of the X11R5 guides. However even if I pass along a suitable colourmap I still get a BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual. The code looks like this: ------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ---------------- Window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpywidthheight) Display *dpy; int width height; { Window win; XVisualInfo vinfo; XSetWindowAttributes attr; fprintf(stderrOpening 8 bit window...\n); if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpyDefaultScreen(dpy)8PseudoColor&vinfo)) { fprintf(stderrYour display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n); exit(1); } fprintf(stderrUsing visual: %x\nvinfo.visual->visualid); cmap = XCreateColormap( dpy DefaultRootWindow(dpy) vinfo.visual AllocNone ); XSync(dpyFalse); XInstallColormap(dpycmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */ attr.colormap = cmap; win = XCreateWindow( dpy DefaultRootWindow(dpy) 1010 widthheight CopyFromParent       /* border width */ 8                    /* depth */ InputOutput          /* class */ vinfo.visual         /* visual */ CWColormap &attr ); return win; } --- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----- Executing this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.

1,Hello Everybody! I have a little question: Due to more features (PEX Drag&Drop) many applications when linked with for example Motif 1.2 instead Motif 1.1 need more memory in the Xserver. X-terminals only have limited memory (normally no swapping possible). So my question: Is there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of free memory available to the Xserver? So one can determine for example whether to start a PEX application with the CSS on client side or on server side (when there is enough memory). Please reply via e-mail I'll summarize!

1,Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price titled Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco. The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort. Without doing a complete review of the paper I'll just mention the goals as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib. Features they want in FRESCO include: lightweight Objects such as Interviews Glyphs Structured Graphics Resolution independence Natural C++ programming interface edit-in-place embedding distributed user interface components Multithreading This by no means captures the complete content of the paper. The Conclusions sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in early 93 with no schedule (paper presented in Jan 93) for a complete sample implementation.

Otherwise they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix. An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community however I'm not really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches C library or compiler patches come out people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license. Hence Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView. Individuals may write software requiring Motif but I doubt it is widely adopted. Regards Richard Gooch....

1,/* Apologies for those who have read this before but no-one has solved this */ /* one yet so I'm posting again! Sorry :-)                                  */ I'm having problems creating a cursor bigger than 64x64 I'm using Motif 1.1 X11R4 running HP-UX 8.07 - all the functions return valid results but no cursor appears when the bitmap is bigger than the aforementioned size. I tried using the following code: unsigned int wh; XQueryBestCursor(XtDisplay(programArea) XtWindow(programArea) 72 71 &w &h); to return the nearest size to what I require however it returns 72 and 71 as the width and height respectively. What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I get round the problem!! Thanks in advance Mike

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness it has enough power to satisfy most users including: standard x-y plots semilog plots log-log plots contour plots 3D plots mesh plots bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different line styles widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical musical and other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent) including a portable metafile format and renderer. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code except header files and those files explicitly granting permission may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely available and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package. We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code especially in the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any published papers please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product we cannot be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the header file plplot.h; see the documentation for more details. The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes. At present PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems: Unix:	SunOS A/IX HP-UX Unicos DG/UX Ultrix SysV Linux Amiga/Exec MS-DOS OS/2 NeXT For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system see: - appendices to the PLPLOT manual - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

1,I have a peculiar color problem with MacX Apple's Macintosh X server. I'd like to know if others have seen the same problem. It's happened with the current version (1.2) and with version 1.1.7. When some types of client windows are displayed parts of the windows are in the wrong color; if the window is moved slightly forcing the server to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors. It doesn't happen for xterm windows but has happened for graphic windows and with some Motif clients. -- Stan Kerr Computing & Communications Services Office U of Illinois/Urbana Phone: 217-333-5217  Email: stankerr@uiuc.edu

1,I want to create a single-line Text widget for entering a small amount of text. I want it to be of fixed width but have a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls automatically when the user types in order to keep the insertion point visible. In trying to do this I have two problems: - The addition of the horizontal scrollbar does not make the text widget taller but instead it seems to cover part of the text. - The scrollbar does not scroll automatically as the user types in text in order to keep the insertion point visible. Any help is appreciated.

What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I > get round the problem!! Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  Or does the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor I think you're probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just that. In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns. -joel

1,I'm having an X resource problem using Brian Wilson's wscrawl 2.0 (a wonderful interactive conferencing program by the way).  I'm running OpenWindows 3.0 on a SPARC 1+ under OS 4.1.3.  I have the following defaults in my .Xdefaults file (among many others): wscrawl.telePointerName:	Kevin wscrawl.syncScrollbars:		True wscrawl.continuousTelePointer:	True wscrawl.showPointerCoordinates:	False wscrawl*background:		LightBlue wscrawl*swindow*foreground:	yellow wscrawl*draw_area_frame*foreground:	Blue wscrawl*keyboardFocusPolicy:	pointer Naturally I exited the server and restarted it after adding those lines to .Xdefaults . If I run the following from a cmdtool (pwd = my home dir.): xrdb -m .Xdefaults and then start up wscrawl then all those defaults are used properly.  Wonderful yes?  Except that I can't get them to be operative except by *manually* invoking the afore-mentioned xrdb command.  If I try: xrdb .Xdefaults the defaults won't take. So I tried to change the xrdb call in my .xinitrc file from: xrdb  $HOME/.Xdefaults to: xrdb -m $HOME/.Xdefaults No go.  So I tried adding in: xrdb -m /home/kbw/.Xdefaults at the beginning or end of my .openwin-init file.  Still no go. Any notions what gives?

1,Hi. I use Emacs and I want to customize my keyboard better. When I set up stuff in my .emacs with a keymap and define-keys I can only access certain of the keys on my X-Terminal's keyboard. I can't get e.g. F10 Home End PgUp PgDn; they all seem to have either the same or no keycode. I have a feeling this can't be fixed in emacs itself but that I need to do some xmodmap stuff.

It should be a pointer not an integer.  XGetWindowProperty() allocates memory copies the data there and returns a pointer to the memory.

1,Hello Motif World a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif++. I got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail and I know of several people who have been using Motif++ and there are probably a number of people I am not aware of who are also using Motif++. My question is: How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list where people can ask questions about Motif++ swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project and this way I can make a list of priorities in what order things should be added or changed. If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list please take the time to reply to this message and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest say about 20 people or more a mailing-list will be set up at my site and I will post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups. -- Ronald van Loon     | In theory there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice. 3DCV Group Utrecht | The Netherlands     | In practice however there is.
1,Greetings I am using an X server that provides 3 visuals: PseudoColor 8 bit Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit. A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24). In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the section about XCteateWindow something like: In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the parent's be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used in the window attributes when creating or else a BadMatch occurs. This warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer editions of the X11R5 guides. However even if I pass along a suitable colourmap I still get a BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual. The code looks like this: ------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ---------------- Window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpywidthheight) Display *dpy; int width height; { Window win; XVisualInfo vinfo; XSetWindowAttributes attr; fprintf(stderrOpening 8 bit window...\n); if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpyDefaultScreen(dpy)8PseudoColor&vinfo)) { fprintf(stderrYour display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n); exit(1); } fprintf(stderrUsing visual: %x\nvinfo.visual->visualid); cmap = XCreateColormap( dpy DefaultRootWindow(dpy) vinfo.visual AllocNone ); XSync(dpyFalse); XInstallColormap(dpycmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */ attr.colormap = cmap; win = XCreateWindow( dpy DefaultRootWindow(dpy) 1010 widthheight CopyFromParent       /* border width */ 8                    /* depth */ InputOutput          /* class */ vinfo.visual         /* visual */ CWColormap &attr ); return win; } --- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----- Executing this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.

1,Hello Everybody! I have a little question: Due to more features (PEX Drag&Drop) many applications when linked with for example Motif 1.2 instead Motif 1.1 need more memory in the Xserver. X-terminals only have limited memory (normally no swapping possible). So my question: Is there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of free memory available to the Xserver? So one can determine for example whether to start a PEX application with the CSS on client side or on server side (when there is enough memory). Please reply via e-mail I'll summarize!

1,Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price titled Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco. The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort. Without doing a complete review of the paper I'll just mention the goals as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib. Features they want in FRESCO include: lightweight Objects such as Interviews Glyphs Structured Graphics Resolution independence Natural C++ programming interface edit-in-place embedding distributed user interface components Multithreading This by no means captures the complete content of the paper. The Conclusions sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in early 93 with no schedule (paper presented in Jan 93) for a complete sample implementation.

Otherwise they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix. An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community however I'm not really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches C library or compiler patches come out people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license. Hence Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView. Individuals may write software requiring Motif but I doubt it is widely adopted. Regards Richard Gooch....

1,I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was able to help me. The problem is that main_win.win is doing fine but when I create detail_win.win it does not receive it's initial expose events until main_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls: main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay) myhint.x myhint.y myhint.width myhint.height main_win.line_thick fg bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay main_win.win main_win.text main_win.text None argv argc &myhint); main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay main_win.win 0 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay detail_win.win); XMapSubwindows (mydisplay main_win.win); The event mask for main_win is: PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask | EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask; The flags are PPosition | PSize I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values): detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay) myhint.x myhint.y myhint.width myhint.height detail_win.line_thick fg bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay main_win.win detail_win.text detail_win.text None argv argc &myhint); detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay detail_win.win 0 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay detail_win.win); Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.

1,Hi I just got myself a Gateway 4DX-33V and trying to configure X11R5 for it.  Has anyone done this before ?  More specifically I need a correct Xconfig file entry that is set up for my graphics card and monitor.  I have a 15 Color CrystalScan 1572FS monitor and a VESA LOCAL BUS ATI Ultra Pro with 1MB VRAM video card. Any help will be extremely appreciated. Thanks in advance.

1,/* Apologies for those who have read this before but no-one has solved this */ /* one yet so I'm posting again! Sorry :-)                                  */ I'm having problems creating a cursor bigger than 64x64 I'm using Motif 1.1 X11R4 running HP-UX 8.07 - all the functions return valid results but no cursor appears when the bitmap is bigger than the aforementioned size. I tried using the following code: unsigned int wh; XQueryBestCursor(XtDisplay(programArea) XtWindow(programArea) 72 71 &w &h); to return the nearest size to what I require however it returns 72 and 71 as the width and height respectively. What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I get round the problem!! Thanks in advance Mike

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness it has enough power to satisfy most users including: standard x-y plots semilog plots log-log plots contour plots 3D plots mesh plots bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different line styles widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical musical and other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent) including a portable metafile format and renderer. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code except header files and those files explicitly granting permission may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely available and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package. We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code especially in the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any published papers please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product we cannot be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the header file plplot.h; see the documentation for more details. The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes. At present PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems: Unix:	SunOS A/IX HP-UX Unicos DG/UX Ultrix SysV Linux Amiga/Exec MS-DOS OS/2 NeXT For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system see: - appendices to the PLPLOT manual - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

1,I have a peculiar color problem with MacX Apple's Macintosh X server. I'd like to know if others have seen the same problem. It's happened with the current version (1.2) and with version 1.1.7. When some types of client windows are displayed parts of the windows are in the wrong color; if the window is moved slightly forcing the server to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors. It doesn't happen for xterm windows but has happened for graphic windows and with some Motif clients. -- Stan Kerr Computing & Communications Services Office U of Illinois/Urbana Phone: 217-333-5217  Email: stankerr@uiuc.edu

1,I want to create a single-line Text widget for entering a small amount of text. I want it to be of fixed width but have a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls automatically when the user types in order to keep the insertion point visible. In trying to do this I have two problems: - The addition of the horizontal scrollbar does not make the text widget taller but instead it seems to cover part of the text. - The scrollbar does not scroll automatically as the user types in text in order to keep the insertion point visible.

What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I > get round the problem!! Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  Or does the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor I think you're probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just that. In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns. -joel

1,I'm having an X resource problem using Brian Wilson's wscrawl 2.0 (a wonderful interactive conferencing program by the way).  I'm running OpenWindows 3.0 on a SPARC 1+ under OS 4.1.3.  I have the following defaults in my .Xdefaults file (among many others): wscrawl.telePointerName:	Kevin wscrawl.syncScrollbars:		True wscrawl.continuousTelePointer:	True wscrawl.showPointerCoordinates:	False wscrawl*background:		LightBlue wscrawl*swindow*foreground:	yellow wscrawl*draw_area_frame*foreground:	Blue wscrawl*keyboardFocusPolicy:	pointer Naturally I exited the server and restarted it after adding those lines to .Xdefaults . If I run the following from a cmdtool (pwd = my home dir.): xrdb -m .Xdefaults and then start up wscrawl then all those defaults are used properly.  Wonderful yes?  Except that I can't get them to be operative except by *manually* invoking the afore-mentioned xrdb command.  If I try: xrdb .Xdefaults the defaults won't take. So I tried to change the xrdb call in my .xinitrc file from: xrdb  $HOME/.Xdefaults to: xrdb -m $HOME/.Xdefaults No go.  So I tried adding in: xrdb -m /home/kbw/.Xdefaults at the beginning or end of my .openwin-init file.  Still no go. Any notions what gives?

1,Hi. I use Emacs and I want to customize my keyboard better. When I set up stuff in my .emacs with a keymap and define-keys I can only access certain of the keys on my X-Terminal's keyboard.

It should be a pointer not an integer.  XGetWindowProperty() allocates memory copies the data there and returns a pointer to the memory.

I create two windows: w1 (child to root) with event_mask = ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask; w2 (child to w1) with do_not_propagate_mask = ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask; Keypress events in w2 are discarded but ButtonPress events fall through to w1 with subwindow set to w2. FYI I'm using xnews/olvwm. Am I doing something fundamentally wrong here? n

Let me add another of my concerns: Yes I can buy a port of Motif for cheap but I cannot get the source for cheap hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X but I have not seen it myself). Currently I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms of which only three came with Motif. On those three I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available. The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5 since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True I could buy another port of Motif but that sort of ruins the whole idea of free doesn't it? Cheers Tom McConnell -- Tom McConnell          |     Internet: tmcconne@sedona.intel.com Intel Corp.

1,We are currently evaluating GUI builders initially for Motif but with a wish to be flexible & portable.  We have been through the popular names (UIMX TeleUSE XVT etc) and have been very impressed with what we have seen of Galaxy from Visix.  I have spoken to current users from a list supplied by Visix (happy users as you would expect) and seen favourable comments on the net.  However since it is fairly expensive to get an evaluation license from Visix I would like to query the net for any negative experiences with Galaxy.  Did anybody evaluate them and prefer another tool or use Galaxy and regret it or find any mis-features ? advTHANKSance Phil -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Phil M Gray                       Voice: (604) 278-3411 MacDonald Dettwiler               Fax:   (604) 278-2117 13800 Commerce Parkway Richmond BC Canada  V6V 2J3     {pmg@mda.ca | ..!uunet!van-bc!mdavcr!pmg}

Can someone help me? It is actually worse than you think.  I have the same problem and have given up.  Emacs has an internal table (somewhere!) which defines what keys it will accept and this table is system-dependent.  I use a Sun from my HP and cannot get 'shift PageUp' to work - xmodmap is not sufficient or at least I haven't worked out how to make it work. However I CAN get ordinary 'PageUp' and 'shift CursorRight' to work and I do some customised things with them. Note that the Emacs on my HP has no problem and I am using exactly the same xmodmap and Emacs configuration.

Begging everyone's pardon I was not slamming Motif nor was I necessarily plugging/flaming the two.  I was responding to the sweet blithe statement in: <rick.734610425@digibd> from rick@digibd.digibd.com (Rick Richardson) rick> This is one area where Microsoft NT has a big advantage.  Since rick> they control the whole show there are no issues like this where rick> licensees create incompatible defacto standards. This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works and they believe that others will also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not by that statement endorsing Sun and its products this is just my experience) and when OpenWindows became hot stuff that was when I started hearing as mentioned before the socialistic masses that were bent on destroying _anything_ that was deemed proprietary including OpenWindows.  I mentioned Motif in the same breath because that is what Sun has decided to turn its attention to not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position I believe is a healthy one and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy NT if it ever shows up wanting instead everything to be free and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are no de facto standards. It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds. Mrs. Henne

1,I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system.  In keeping with more classic command and control type systems we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor. I have a number of X level questions regarding this: (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be predominantly Sun's probably with ports to RS/6000 as well). I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens and not multiple X displays.   Given this: - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between screens? - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there? What are they; who sells them... - Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a window frame and move a window from one screen to the next? - Is there any way for the application to transparently see multiple screens as one logical x-y plane or does the hardware only provide for each screen to start at 00? - Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a system capable of using either multiple screens or a single screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate multiple screens instead)? I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely on providing config files which will specify for each configuration the screen placement of each window in the application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience are more than welcome. ======================================================================== Jo Pelkey                                   Phone: (509)375-6947 Battelle Pacific Northwest Labs             Fax:   (509)375-3641 Mail Stop K7-22                             Email: je_pelkey@pnl.gov P.O.

1,G'Day Windows NT is a step forward but not by much. I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to be able to use more than 64K of memory its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even a real issue. My ideal operating system: Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize binaries and configure on the fly so I don't have to have bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc... Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in 80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips. Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems. Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly. so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential. Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS or NT or OS/2 and run shell scripts or command/BAT files. Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly. In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight clean kernel so you can actually understand it.

One can't.  The application may not have been started from a terminal emulator; if it was the terminal emulator may not still exist and if it does it may be in no condition to be pop[ped] to the top (eg it may be iconified).  And even if you can it may not do what you want - consider a virtual-root window manager like tvtwm with the relevant window in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outside the real desktop. Some (but not all) X terminal emulators provide environment variables giving a window ID.  Even if such a thing is present in the environment it may not be what you want; it may correspond to a window on a different server for example. der Mouse mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu

Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean: > 	-) multi-screen > 	-) multi-headed > 	-) multi-display > 	-) X-Server zaphod mode As applied to servers the first three are fuzzy terms.  multi-headed tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors sometimes even multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg a Sun with a cg4 display).  multi-screen and multi-display would if taken strictly mean different things but since the strict meaning of multi-display would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers when it's used it probably refers to the same thing multi-screen would: a system that provides multiple Screens. zaphod is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen. > Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle > (in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ? There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine but this is not a limitation inherent to X. What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X the author of the article had no business writing about X. der Mouse mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention. The necessity it refers to has always been there but it's been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window. > However even if I pass along a suitable colourmap I still get a > BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual. >   attr.colormap = cmap; >   win = XCreateWindow( [...] >           CopyFromParent       /* border width */ >           8                    /* depth */ >           InputOutput          /* class */ >           vinfo.visual         /* visual */ >           CWColormap >           &attr >         ); This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth or a border-pixel and the problem should go away. There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero to simplify the conversion to wire format so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair I'm not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.) der Mouse mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu

No.  Even if you could the answer could be out of date even before you get it (even if you grab the server it could be taken up by buffering user actions).

It doesn't happen I have the exact same problem when running Hewlett Packard's Microwave Design System (MDS) from an HP 380 unix box and running MacX 1.2 Sys 7.0.1*. Normally MDS draws a window with a deep blue backround but occasionally it becomes a light blue and all the text etc inside the window become washed out (nearly invisible). I thought that it was just something brain dead that I was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or INIT. By slightly moving the window and forcing a re-draw the colors get corrected.

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems. That said Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display 3 2-screen displays 6 1-screen displays or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination. Because of this we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning and (at least in X) have exact definitions. The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT this is 3. As released by Megatek this is 12. As such the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case. We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course I could say Buy all you want we'll support more. -- ---- Rusty Sanders Megatek Corp. --> rgs@megatek.com or... ...ucsd!    ...hplabs!hp-sdd!    ...ames!scubed!   ...uunet!

The problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems including (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things): - Core Dump - BadPixmap X Error - Widget not unmapped Here is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem: #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> void bla() { XtAppContext app; Display *dis = XOpenDisplay(); int junk = 0; Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&app test NULL 0 &junk NULL NULL NULL 0); Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(blaaa xmPushButtonWidgetClass top XmNheight 50 XmNwidth 50 NULL); XtRealizeWidget(top); //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents for (int i=0;i<=10;i++) { XEvent event; XtAppNextEvent(app &event); XtDispatchEvent(&event); } // WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE??? XtUnrealizeWidget(top); XtDestroyWidget(top); XtDestroyApplicationContext(app); XCloseDisplay(dis); // ??? } main() { for (int i=0;i<=20;i++) bla(); } Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program. With this example I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent) the 5th call to bla(): X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter) Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC) Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d Serial number of failed request:  71 Current serial number in output stream:  86 If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line it just dumps core on the seconds call. Furthermore every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time) I get: Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice. So finally my question is this: What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times? Any help would be greatly appreciated. PLEASE respond via email as I dont usually have time to read this group. Thanks very much. -davewood -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1,I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c.  The X distribution has support for this config and the release notes say it has been tested on the machine.  BUT also in the release notes nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I supposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported but not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that can be used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions but I'm *really* confused. -- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class. -Unknown
1,Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines and all the new libraries utils etc. will be installed and my old server from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0 and have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs? Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public? It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :) -- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class. -Unknown
1,Forgive me if this is a FAQ (I have checked the list but I cant find it). I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors) The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input field. The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block but how do you do this. I can't find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done. When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block. This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the default either.

1,Hello Motif World a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif++. I got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail and I know of several people who have been using Motif++ and there are probably a number of people I am not aware of who are also using Motif++. My question is: How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list where people can ask questions about Motif++ swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project and this way I can make a list of priorities in what order things should be added or changed. If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list please take the time to reply to this message and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest say about 20 people or more a mailing-list will be set up at my site and I will post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups. -- Ronald van Loon     | In theory there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice. 3DCV Group Utrecht | The Netherlands     | In practice however there is.
1,Greetings I am using an X server that provides 3 visuals: PseudoColor 8 bit Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit. A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24). In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the section about XCteateWindow something like: In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the parent's be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used in the window attributes when creating or else a BadMatch occurs. This warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer editions of the X11R5 guides. However even if I pass along a suitable colourmap I still get a BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual. The code looks like this: ------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ---------------- Window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpywidthheight) Display *dpy; int width height; { Window win; XVisualInfo vinfo; XSetWindowAttributes attr; fprintf(stderrOpening 8 bit window...\n); if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpyDefaultScreen(dpy)8PseudoColor&vinfo)) { fprintf(stderrYour display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n); exit(1); } fprintf(stderrUsing visual: %x\nvinfo.visual->visualid); cmap = XCreateColormap( dpy DefaultRootWindow(dpy) vinfo.visual AllocNone ); XSync(dpyFalse); XInstallColormap(dpycmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */ attr.colormap = cmap; win = XCreateWindow( dpy DefaultRootWindow(dpy) 1010 widthheight CopyFromParent       /* border width */ 8                    /* depth */ InputOutput          /* class */ vinfo.visual         /* visual */ CWColormap &attr ); return win; } --- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----- Executing this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.

1,Hello Everybody! I have a little question: Due to more features (PEX Drag&Drop) many applications when linked with for example Motif 1.2 instead Motif 1.1 need more memory in the Xserver. X-terminals only have limited memory (normally no swapping possible). So my question: Is there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of free memory available to the Xserver? So one can determine for example whether to start a PEX application with the CSS on client side or on server side (when there is enough memory). Please reply via e-mail I'll summarize!

1,Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price titled Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco. The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort. Without doing a complete review of the paper I'll just mention the goals as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib. Features they want in FRESCO include: lightweight Objects such as Interviews Glyphs Structured Graphics Resolution independence Natural C++ programming interface edit-in-place embedding distributed user interface components Multithreading This by no means captures the complete content of the paper. The Conclusions sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in early 93 with no schedule (paper presented in Jan 93) for a complete sample implementation.

Otherwise they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix. An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community however I'm not really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches C library or compiler patches come out people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license. Hence Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView. Individuals may write software requiring Motif but I doubt it is widely adopted. Regards Richard Gooch....

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness it has enough power to satisfy most users including: standard x-y plots semilog plots log-log plots contour plots 3D plots mesh plots bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different line styles widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical musical and other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent) including a portable metafile format and renderer. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code except header files and those files explicitly granting permission may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors.

Also please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product we cannot be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the header file plplot.h; see the documentation for more details. The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes. At present PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems: Unix:	SunOS A/IX HP-UX Unicos DG/UX Ultrix SysV Linux Amiga/Exec MS-DOS OS/2 NeXT For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system see: - appendices to the PLPLOT manual - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

1,I have a peculiar color problem with MacX Apple's Macintosh X server. I'd like to know if others have seen the same problem. It's happened with the current version (1.2) and with version 1.1.7. When some types of client windows are displayed parts of the windows are in the wrong color; if the window is moved slightly forcing the server to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors. It doesn't happen for xterm windows but has happened for graphic windows and with some Motif clients. -- Stan Kerr Computing & Communications Services Office U of Illinois/Urbana Phone: 217-333-5217  Email: stankerr@uiuc.edu
1,Hi * Has anyone out there compile a list of X security holes??  If yes will you please send me a copy of this??  If this is a wrong group please point me to a right one.  Thanks!! BTW the list doesn't have to contain the info How to use the holes?.  Instead I need the info of how to detect the holes how to seal the holes and how to monitor the activities if possible. Any info is welcomed.

1,I want to create a single-line Text widget for entering a small amount of text. I want it to be of fixed width but have a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls automatically when the user types in order to keep the insertion point visible. In trying to do this I have two problems: - The addition of the horizontal scrollbar does not make the text widget taller but instead it seems to cover part of the text. - The scrollbar does not scroll automatically as the user types in text in order to keep the insertion point visible. Any help is appreciated.

What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I > get round the problem!! Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  Or does the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor I think you're probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just that. In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns. -joel

1,I'm having an X resource problem using Brian Wilson's wscrawl 2.0 (a wonderful interactive conferencing program by the way).  I'm running OpenWindows 3.0 on a SPARC 1+ under OS 4.1.3.  I have the following defaults in my .Xdefaults file (among many others): wscrawl.telePointerName:	Kevin wscrawl.syncScrollbars:		True wscrawl.continuousTelePointer:	True wscrawl.showPointerCoordinates:	False wscrawl*background:		LightBlue wscrawl*swindow*foreground:	yellow wscrawl*draw_area_frame*foreground:	Blue wscrawl*keyboardFocusPolicy:	pointer Naturally I exited the server and restarted it after adding those lines to .Xdefaults . If I run the following from a cmdtool (pwd = my home dir.): xrdb -m .Xdefaults and then start up wscrawl then all those defaults are used properly.  Wonderful yes?  Except that I can't get them to be operative except by *manually* invoking the afore-mentioned xrdb command.  If I try: xrdb .Xdefaults the defaults won't take. So I tried to change the xrdb call in my .xinitrc file from: xrdb  $HOME/.Xdefaults to: xrdb -m $HOME/.Xdefaults No go.  So I tried adding in: xrdb -m /home/kbw/.Xdefaults at the beginning or end of my .openwin-init file.  Still no go. Any notions what gives?

1,Hi. I use Emacs and I want to customize my keyboard better. When I set up stuff in my .emacs with a keymap and define-keys I can only access certain of the keys on my X-Terminal's keyboard. I can't get e.g. F10 Home End PgUp PgDn; they all seem to have either the same or no keycode. I have a feeling this can't be fixed in emacs itself but that I need to do some xmodmap stuff. Can someone help me? By the way I've checked the X-FAQ and posted a similar message to gnu.emacs.help to no response.

It should be a pointer not an integer.  XGetWindowProperty() allocates memory copies the data there and returns a pointer to the memory.

Let me add another of my concerns: Yes I can buy a port of Motif for cheap but I cannot get the source for cheap hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X but I have not seen it myself). Currently I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms of which only three came with Motif. On those three I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available. The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5 since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True I could buy another port of Motif but that sort of ruins the whole idea of free doesn't it? Cheers Tom McConnell -- Tom McConnell          |     Internet: tmcconne@sedona.intel.com Intel Corp.

1,We are currently evaluating GUI builders initially for Motif but with a wish to be flexible & portable.  We have been through the popular names (UIMX TeleUSE XVT etc) and have been very impressed with what we have seen of Galaxy from Visix.  I have spoken to current users from a list supplied by Visix (happy users as you would expect) and seen favourable comments on the net.

1,I have two Motif Widgets. I would like to control one of them via the keyboard and the other with the mouse. I set the keyboard focus on the first widget but as soon as I click the mouse on the second one I lose the keyboard focus on the first one. Could some kind soul show me how to do this? Thanks DM dev@hollywood.acsc.com

Can someone help me? It is actually worse than you think.  I have the same problem and have given up.  Emacs has an internal table (somewhere!) which defines what keys it will accept and this table is system-dependent.  I use a Sun from my HP and cannot get 'shift PageUp' to work - xmodmap is not sufficient or at least I haven't worked out how to make it work. However I CAN get ordinary 'PageUp' and 'shift CursorRight' to work and I do some customised things with them. Note that the Emacs on my HP has no problem and I am using exactly the same xmodmap and Emacs configuration.

Begging everyone's pardon I was not slamming Motif nor was I necessarily plugging/flaming the two.

Since rick> they control the whole show there are no issues like this where rick> licensees create incompatible defacto standards. This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works and they believe that others will also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not by that statement endorsing Sun and its products this is just my experience) and when OpenWindows became hot stuff that was when I started hearing as mentioned before the socialistic masses that were bent on destroying _anything_ that was deemed proprietary including OpenWindows.  I mentioned Motif in the same breath because that is what Sun has decided to turn its attention to not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position I believe is a healthy one and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy NT if it ever shows up wanting instead everything to be free and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are no de facto standards. It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds. Mrs. Henne

1,I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system.  In keeping with more classic command and control type systems we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor. I have a number of X level questions regarding this: (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be predominantly Sun's probably with ports to RS/6000 as well). I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens and not multiple X displays.   Given this: - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between screens? - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there? What are they; who sells them... - Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a window frame and move a window from one screen to the next? - Is there any way for the application to transparently see multiple screens as one logical x-y plane or does the hardware only provide for each screen to start at 00? - Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a system capable of using either multiple screens or a single screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate multiple screens instead)? I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely on providing config files which will specify for each configuration the screen placement of each window in the application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience are more than welcome. ======================================================================== Jo Pelkey                                   Phone: (509)375-6947 Battelle Pacific Northwest Labs             Fax:   (509)375-3641 Mail Stop K7-22                             Email: je_pelkey@pnl.gov P.O.

1,G'Day Windows NT is a step forward but not by much. I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to be able to use more than 64K of memory its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even a real issue. My ideal operating system: Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize binaries and configure on the fly so I don't have to have bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc... Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in 80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips. Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems. Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly. so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential. Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS or NT or OS/2 and run shell scripts or command/BAT files. Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly. In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight clean kernel so you can actually understand it.

One can't.  The application may not have been started from a terminal emulator; if it was the terminal emulator may not still exist and if it does it may be in no condition to be pop[ped] to the top (eg it may be iconified).  And even if you can it may not do what you want - consider a virtual-root window manager like tvtwm with the relevant window in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outside the real desktop.

Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean: > 	-) multi-screen > 	-) multi-headed > 	-) multi-display > 	-) X-Server zaphod mode As applied to servers the first three are fuzzy terms.  multi-headed tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors sometimes even multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg a Sun with a cg4 display).  multi-screen and multi-display would if taken strictly mean different things but since the strict meaning of multi-display would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers when it's used it probably refers to the same thing multi-screen would: a system that provides multiple Screens. zaphod is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen. > Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle > (in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ? There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine but this is not a limitation inherent to X. What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X the author of the article had no business writing about X. der Mouse mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention. The necessity it refers to has always been there but it's been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window. > However even if I pass along a suitable colourmap I still get a > BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual. >   attr.colormap = cmap; >   win = XCreateWindow( [...] >           CopyFromParent       /* border width */ >           8                    /* depth */ >           InputOutput          /* class */ >           vinfo.visual         /* visual */ >           CWColormap >           &attr >         ); This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth or a border-pixel and the problem should go away. There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero to simplify the conversion to wire format so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair I'm not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.) der Mouse mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu

It doesn't happen I have the exact same problem when running Hewlett Packard's Microwave Design System (MDS) from an HP 380 unix box and running MacX 1.2 Sys 7.0.1*. Normally MDS draws a window with a deep blue backround but occasionally it becomes a light blue and all the text etc inside the window become washed out (nearly invisible). I thought that it was just something brain dead that I was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or INIT. By slightly moving the window and forcing a re-draw the colors get corrected.

1,Hello way back in the mists of time I had a set of patches written by Richard Caley (I believe to the standars distribution patch level 6) which added regular expressions in the .tvtwmrc file multiple icon regions squeezable icons and f.deleteordestroy function. I still have the patches however I can no longer find the sources to which they applied ;-). I'd appreciate if some kind soul could send me a pointer to where I could find the sources. Has anyone updated the patches for R5? (Richard? are you out there? pretty please?) Thanks in advance. manoj

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems. That said Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display 3 2-screen displays 6 1-screen displays or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination. Because of this we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning and (at least in X) have exact definitions. The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT this is 3. As released by Megatek this is 12. As such the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case. We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course I could say Buy all you want we'll support more. -- ---- Rusty Sanders Megatek Corp. --> rgs@megatek.com or... ...ucsd!    ...hplabs!hp-sdd!    ...ames!scubed!   ...uunet!
1,The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read on... I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget displays the widget for a while then destroys everything and returns.  The problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems including (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things): - Core Dump - BadPixmap X Error - Widget not unmapped Here is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem: #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> void bla() { XtAppContext app; Display *dis = XOpenDisplay(); int junk = 0; Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&app test NULL 0 &junk NULL NULL NULL 0); Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(blaaa xmPushButtonWidgetClass top XmNheight 50 XmNwidth 50 NULL); XtRealizeWidget(top); //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents for (int i=0;i<=10;i++) { XEvent event; XtAppNextEvent(app &event); XtDispatchEvent(&event); } // WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE??? XtUnrealizeWidget(top); XtDestroyWidget(top); XtDestroyApplicationContext(app); XCloseDisplay(dis); // ??? } main() { for (int i=0;i<=20;i++) bla(); } Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program. With this example I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent) the 5th call to bla(): X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter) Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC) Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d Serial number of failed request:  71 Current serial number in output stream:  86 If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line it just dumps core on the seconds call. Furthermore every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time) I get: Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice. So finally my question is this: What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1,I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c.  The X distribution has support for this config and the release notes say it has been tested on the machine.  BUT also in the release notes nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I supposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported but not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that can be used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions but I'm *really* confused. -- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class. -Unknown
1,Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines and all the new libraries utils etc. will be installed and my old server from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0 and have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs? Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public? It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :) -- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class. -Unknown
1,Forgive me if this is a FAQ (I have checked the list but I cant find it). I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors) The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input field. The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block but how do you do this. I can't find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done. When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block. This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the default either.

1,Hi Folks. As part of my self-introduction to X I've been trying to do some simple icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your own applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately you can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with icons which your application doesn't specifically own. In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in my icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id how do you change the icon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes any difference I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE. Thanks - Scott :)
1,Contents:Problems with table widgets in R5 The following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation system) did work in R4 but refused to in R5. Of cause the R4-version did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass 			instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition 			(formerly XtTblPosition). Since compiling with R5 the program causes a zero width or height error (on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText widgets) exist XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero. Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not).

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.  A button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() (or equiv) directly; instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the Window is mapped. The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is visible and mapped.  Do you know the best way to tickle a window so that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?

1,If you're willing to do a little work you can make DrawnButtons do what you want more-or-less. One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that in our internal LYMB system. We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of dial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then drawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knob's state and changes to the next pixmap in the sequence. Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular portion of the parent widget but that's normally not a big shortcoming. You can make things look circular enough. -- Skip (montanaro@crd.ge.com) Why can't X be this easy? -- me after learning about dlopen()

Anyone have any ideas ?? I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network itself. To give you a real-world example here at Quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell file servers and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators so you have 20-30 people on each segment). If you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns. But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have 10 people running programs off it you're going to see some slowdowns because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice but if you have 10 working programs running you'll know it. Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing) you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also...) -- Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels Pricing/Ordering : info@qdeck.com  |  Tech Questions : support@qdeck.com BBS: (310) 314-3227 * FAX: (310) 314-3217 * Compuserve: GO QUARTERDECK Q/Fax: (310) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand!
1,Hi netters I'm using sliders in my XView apps usually with editable numeric field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by PANEL_MAX_VALUE! As I understand PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items doesn't work in the case of slider despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit: /* Panel_multiline_text_item Panel_numeric_text_item * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes */ PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM			 152) PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT		 182) which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute and return value 0. Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me and clear this problem? Any help is very much appreciated. Yuri yuri@uk.ac.hw.phy

1,Is there aything available for X similar to QuicKeys for the Macintosh -- something that will allow me to store and playback sequences of keystrokes menu selections and mouse actions - directing them towards another application? If so could someone send me information on its availability -- and if not how hard do we think it might be to send input to other X applications and hopefully deal with their responses appropriately?  (If an application is going to take a few seconds to process I probably have to wait  for it to complete before sending another command.) thanks david
1,(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered) Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.  A button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() (or equiv) directly; instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles regular expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a proper way to do this because at the time the handler is called the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped. The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow tickle the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item. What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?

1,I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed. Currently to draw interactively I begin with: /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */ /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */ palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red; palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green; palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue; XStoreColors( myDisplay my_cmap &palette_colors[DrawIndex] 1); XFlush( myDisplay); XSetFunction( myDisplay gc GXxor); XSetForeground( myDisplay gc drawIndex); Then to draw I do: XDrawLine( myDisplay XtWindow( drawingArea1) gc x1 y1 x2 y2); XFlush( myDisplay); And when I'm all done to return things to normal I do: XSetFunction( myDisplay gc GXcopy); What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box it erases and redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image). Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong? david

If your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed rectangle information then you can use XClearArea to generate an Expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not None) for the enclosing rectangle of your new item. This is still not great since any other items contained within that rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn. If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything you'll be doing much more work than just drawing the new item on top of the existing scene. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike Yang        Silicon Graphics Inc. mikey@sgi.com           415/390-1786
1,Hi has anybody implements an RPC server in the HP Xwindows? In SUN Xview there is a notify_enable_rpc_svc() call that automatically executes the rpc processes when it detects an incoming request.

1,I am developing an X (XtXm) application that will include a graphics window of some sort with moving symbols among other things.  A pure X application could be implemented with Motif widgets one of which would be an XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib.  But I would like to take advantage of the Graphics Library (GL) available on our IBM RS/6000 (SGI's GL i believe). Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program? Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me with XOpenWindow? I have never used GL before but the doc on GL winopen() says that the first time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server.   Also most of the GL calls do not require a Display or GC unlike most X calls.  From this initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.   Is this true? Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL? Environment: AIXwindows X11R4 Motif 1.1 GL is available AIX Sys V 3.2 IBM RS/6000 360 Thanks in advance.

Hmmm.... Clearly?  Depends on your programming model.  It is not at all forbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event.  Certainly any internal data structures should be maintained such that the visual appearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens to be generated.  This doesn't preclude drawing immediately after updating the datastructures though... -Rob

1,Hi Experts I'm kind of new to X. The following question is strange to me. I am trying to modify the contents of the colormap but failed without reason (to me). I am using the following piece of code: toplevel = XtInitialize(argv[0] Testcolor NULL 0 &argc argv); dpy = XtDisplay(toplevel); scr = DefaultScreen(dpy); def_colormap = DefaultColormap(dpyscr); if(XAllocColorCells(dpy def_colormap True NULL 0 cells 5)) { color.pixel = cells[0]; color.red = 250; color.green = 125; color.blue = 0; color.flags = DoRed | DoGreen | DoBlue; XStoreColor(dpy def_colormap &color); printf(\n Try to allocate the color %d as (%d%d%d) color.pixel color.red color.green color.blue); XQueryColor(dpy def_colormap &color); printf(\n After  allocate the color %d is (%d%d%d) color.pixel color.red color.green color.blue); } else printf(\n Error: couldn't allocate color cells); Running output: Try to allocate the color 7 as (2501250) After  allocate the color 7 is (000) After XStoreColor() XQueryColor() just returned the original value. No failure/error displayed but the contents of colormap are obvious unchanged. (I also tried to draw a line using the colors but it turned out to be the unmodified colors.) So what is my problem? How to modify the contents of the colormap? Any help/information will be appreciated.

I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and when the new application starts up it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap. It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors.  This makes it look ugly until it's window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so that the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted but now other applications are having to make do with it's colormap. This is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I have seen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap. My solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) display applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather than in color (if this is an option for the application). - Doug Shaker voice:	415/572-0200 fax:	415/572-1300 email:	dshaker@qualix.com mail:	Qualix Group 1900 S.

1,Hi. I'm trying to figure out how to make a window manager place the window where the create window command tells it regardless of what it may think is right. (my application has reason to know better) I don't want to set the override-redirect because I do want all the embellishments that the window manager gives I just want the wm to accept my choice of location. I've tried twm tvtwm and mwm and they are all uncooperative. Thanks -- Ethan

If I understand your problem correctly you want to have a way to send exposures to your manager widget when your app-specific code draws xlib graphics on the window. It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using XSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to send the exposure generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects you can use XCreateRegion to create a region XUnionRectWithRegion to add the new object polygons to the region and then either use the region to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn. Keeping in mind that the stacking order of overlapping objects affects how they look.

I specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment came from a simple open-draw-quit client. As per your question: why not have the button handler add the object and then call the window_redraw() (or whatever) directly?  Although depending on how the overall application is structured there may be no problem with rendering the object directly in response to the button press.

In example 3.5 page 76 : Creating a pop-up dialog box The application creates window with a button Quit and Press me. The button Press me pops up a dialog box. The strange feature of this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the first time. If I try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd 4th .... time) it is *much* slower. Has anyone any experience with these sample programs or why I get this behaviour - fast response time for the first time but slow response time from 2nd time onwards ? Anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time they popup in reasonable fast response time ? Thankyou - Shirley

1,# #I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band #boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a #colormap and am using almost all of the colors.

1,I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling it's get value function.  I am pretty sure this is happening because I am not using XtAppMainLoop but am dealing with events via sockets.  (ya ya). Anyway I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget(s) will call their get value callback.  Or if someone knows another FAST way around this (or any way for that matter) let me know.  I cannot (or I don't think) call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for the third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data). In other words I want to force a strip chart widget to update itself. Any ideas anyone? -- Christopher R.

1,I need to write an application which does annotation notes on existing documents.  The annotation could be done several times by different people.  The idea is something like having several acetate transparencies stacked on top of each other so that the user can see through all of them.  I've seen something like this being done by the oclock client. Could someone please tell me how to do it in Xt? Thank you very much.

1,We've developed a number of applications using DevGuide and found it to be a very useful tool. I've been impressed with the level of integration it affords using the connection editor. I love the general ease of use. I talked with Tali Aben at Sun today about DevGuide + Motif. She was very helpful. We provided some input as to what we'd like to see in the next version of DevGuide. Tali was very enthusiatic about our comments. I mentioned I was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additional comments from the net on what DevGuide should evolve into. Send your comments/wish-list raving et. al. about DevGuide to: Tali.Aben@Sun.COM Pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want.... More of this and computers may have a future. Frankly I like the idea that it will offer some migration capability to DOE/DOMF through an integrated ToolTalk capability pointed out in March's SunExpert magazine. Technology works we can crankout the interfaces with DevGuide. Price is outstanding.

1,[posted for a friend] Okay I looked through the FAQs and didn't see this but I know its come up before... XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order: Try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits) Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match. and when all else fails Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors already allocated in the colormap. This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap and no unallocated cells then XAllocColor fails even when it has already allocated several other cells already and there are dozens of read-only cells already in the colormap. Is this a bug?  A feature?  A misunderstanding on my part? Any help appreciated Noel (ngorelic@speclab.cr.usgs.gov)

1,Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP and DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also running TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure on the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows client shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well? My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making TCP/IP specific socket calls. In this case the answer would be no; you can not run XDM over DECnet. Is this right or not? Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks.

1,I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some problems.  Actually it seems that this is more of a GCC question because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000. Basically there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in let's say CompositeP.h for instance the composite widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type : typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget) but in several places in the HP source code they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one as the prototype suggests.  For example: (*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w args p_num_args) Now GCC chokes on this giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function.  So does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in GCC or how I can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions. Many thanks in advance for any help. -- <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> Bill Woodward        | wpwood@austin.ibm.com   <-- Try this first AIX Software Support | billw@aixwiz.austin.ibm.com Graphics Group       | 512-838-2834 I am the terror that flaps in the night.

1,I've just managed to get xdm running from an NCR 3000 (an SVR4 486 box running XFree86 1.2) to my NCD XDisplay.  It's pretty much working but I'm encountering a weird error.  I'm attempting to start an xterm from my .xsession file but nothing happens.  Redirecting stderr to a file using 'exec 2>$HOME/.xerrors' in .xsession reveals the error message: xterm: Error 14 errno 1: Not owner Now if I start xterm from the window manager or from the command line it works fine.  And starting other clients like the window manager (mwm) and a clock from my .xsession also works. Anyone encountered this?

1,I am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being clipped when entered in an xterm window under motif. I have reprogrammed the F1 key to transmit a <ff> <be> character sequence by using the following line in .Xdefaults: ~Ctrl ~Shift ~Alt <Key> F1 : string(0xff) string(0xbe) \n\ I merge in this line with xrdb -merge and then create the new xterm which has the remapped F1 key. The problem that arises is that the application which is recieving input at the time only sees a <7f> <3e> sequence which is <ff> <be> with the high order bit of each character being filtered or ignored. When I run xev and press the F1 key I get the correct value showing up in the following two key events: KeyPress event serial 14 synthetic NO window 0x2800001 root 0x28 subw 0x0 time 2067815294 (6780) root:(74104) state 0x0 keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe F1) same_screen YES XLookupString gives 0 characters:   KeyRelease event serial 16 synthetic NO window 0x2800001 root 0x28 subw 0x0 time 2067815406 (6780) root:(74104) state 0x0 keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe F1) same_screen YES XLookupString gives 0 characters:   Notice that the keysym being transmitted is correct; 0xffbe. But when I use the F1 key while in vi or in a program I wrote to spit back the hex values of keyboard input I only get <7f> <3e>. Does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what I can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to the final application? Any help is greatly appreciated. Please *email* any responses. Jim Kavitsky kavitsky@hsi.com
1,Yes it's possible... in fact there's some gl widget code in /usr/lpp/GL somewhere... (it's named Glib.c; my IBM's down right now though so I can't find the exact location :) WARNING: this code feels quite bogus. It does things like calling noport() before winopen() and then extracting an X window id from it anyway. It worked just fine under aix 3.1; I spent last weekend trying to port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 doesn't seem to like it) and it's turning into a Hard Job. Check out your info pages; it has some pretty good documentation on whan you can and can't do when mixing gl and X and how to go about doing so. )Rob

There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or GlxDraw (athena) widget.

To incrementally update the contents of windows I use the following trick: 1. Set the window background to None 2. Call XClearArea(display window 0 0 0 0 True) 3. Restore the window background to its correct value. The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background but still generates exposure events for visible parts of the window. In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled incrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to be erased) I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client messages which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server. XGrabServer(display) client message (start-incremental) background None XClearArea Restore background client message (end-incremental) XUngrabServer(display) The GrabServer prevents other events to be inserted by the server in the critical section. --- Vincent Prunet Sema Group Sophia Antipolis INRIA       BP 93    06902 SOPHIA ANTIPOLIS Cedex  FRANCE prunet@sophia.inria.fr (33) 93 65 78 42 Fax:(33) 93 65 77 66

Since you're dipslaying only a single plane of your data it's possible that all the pixel values in your pixmap have the same value for that color plane.

1,Hi Please reply to me direct as I am not a member of this list. I am new to X so please excuse my lax (read: probably incorrect) terminology! Environment: Sun Sparc 10 SunOs 4.1.3.  X11R5 path level 23.  My X process is started by xdm. i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)! The setup is as follows: lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc tvtwm There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home directory. The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm login window as expected - very nice! Unfortunately when the users session is started the background of the tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an xterm window when the session has started the background is changed as expected. The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the the users session startup? ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10 not all of the keys are recognised and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters. ie: real key       key shown on screen ------------   ------------------- hash           back slash tilde          pipe double quote   at symbol pound          hash cursor key     not recognised This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and termcap as they seemed more uptodate. Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as expected! Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

Make sure you're using ssetroot which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm starts up it nukes the existing root window.  Use an ssetroot after tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a (sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&) You can also use VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename or just VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey. > ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10 not all of the keys are recognised >     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters. Did you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export. All the keys on my keyboard send events properly except the following: The End PageUp PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized. Even the compose key works.  (Though I can't seem to get the composed characters in an xterm to get passed.)

1,Dear SGI and netter GL-X Mixed-Model experts I am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different color maps for different windows and I've been having trouble getting the window manager to reliably honor my requests.  In some environments (entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly connected to their designated color maps but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX; also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating. I would dearly appreciate 1. an explanation of the standard RIGHT CORRECT way to give a window a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it; 2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my desired colormaps. By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this having tried everything reasonable or imaginable. Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING* to do this.

My computer configuration with the X problem is as follows: 486DX50/256/16RAM  running Esix 4.0.4 Wangtek AT-style interface 250 M tape drive. I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and inet utilities (tcp/ip). I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly. I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems. However if I try to access the tape drive while in X the machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the tape the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to startx again; the screen changes modes but the grey background pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system. I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4 server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem. I would like to get both X and my tape drive to co-exist on the same system.  If you can shed any light on the problem it would be appreciated. One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict.  If this is true what direction should I look to resolve the conflict ?

1,According to the OSF/Motif Style Guide one should use cursor shapes to give the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. So a hourglass cursor should be shown when the application is busy or a caution cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined for some windows e.g. a crosswire cursor for a DrawingArea things get even more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier but is this so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem please let me know. The topics on busy cursors in the several FAQ's are not helpful since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to 'None'. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Hans Geurtsen                       Phone: (31) (0) 8385 - 33157 Nucletron Research BV.             e-mail: hgn@nuclint.nl Surface: Waardgelder 1 NL-3905 TH  Veenendaal
1,I am trying to find out if my application is running on a local or a remote display.  A local display being connected to the same system that the client is executing on.  I have access to the display string but can I tell from the string? If the client is executing on host foo then :0 unix:0 foo:0 and localhost:0 are all local.  Under Ultrix I believe that local:0 is also a valid display name (a shared memory connection maybe?).  Are there other strings that I should check for?  Is there a better way to detect this? Thank you for any help you can give me. -- ======================================================================== Jim Atkinson		Wavefront Technologies Inc. jra@wti.com		What me?

1,Some time back I asked for software recommendations to  allow me to run X from my PC at home to my Sparc at the office. Many thanks for all replies the majority of people  recommended PCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on my Sparc and PC with only one hitch. The UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory. On the PC side I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows installation. The only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory had the line DISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY s.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console. By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned and the clients connected to the server at `hostname`:1.0 Some comments on performance I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line. My PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra 16 MB Bitmap Stuff Sucked. Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable. Xmail was very usable. At times the first time U typed in an Xclient window there was a very noticable delay I put this down to brain damaged WINDOWS should not be called a SCHEDULER besides that this will become my remote work environment for a while. Has anybody tried the NON Windows version of the product the sales person said they performed about the same given the over head of WINDOWS I question this? many thanks for help to all who responded gerard
1,I have a Sun 3/60 that has a mono framebuffer (bwtwo0 ?) built on the motherboard.  The same system also has a cgfour (cgfour0 and bwtwo1 ?) daughterboard.  I have been using this system with a color monitor having a color front screen from the cgfour and a mono back screen from the bwtwo1 both on the same tube.  I recentley picked up a 1600 x 1280 Sun mono monitor and I would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour0 and the bwtwo0.  I do not care if I loose the back screen on the color tube from the bwtwo1.  After looking through the Xsun man page I am not sure if this is possible.  Has anybody sucessfuly done this before? --Matthew
1,The COSE announcement specifies that Motif will become the common GUI. But what does this mean exactly? - Do they mean that all COSE-complient apps will have the Motif look and feel? - Do they mean that all COSE-complient apps will use the Motif toolkit API? - Do they mean both of the above? - Is it possible that there will be a Motif-API complient toolkit with an OpenLook Look & Feel? - How about an OLIT/XView/OI/Interviews API toolkit with a Motif L & F? (I know OI already does this but will this be considered COSE-complient?) - Will there be more than one standard toolkit API or L & F supported? - How does using ToolTalk fit in with Motif? This is my attempt to start a discussion in order to pull as much knowledge about these questions off the net...

1,The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An option in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be Tek-term) is active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus let me know.) The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it. Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics but does not move the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve screen space it stays an icon. The desired behavior: one of two options - 1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the inactive one. 2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated it should revert to a icon but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher level than the Xterm. What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term. These commands would I'd guess need to be in the Fortran or in the command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term. Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif. Thanks for your time.

If you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the X server you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server (MIT-SHM). xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS. A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT server. I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI by the way) which yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images running on a Sparc IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for animations. Regards Richard Gooch....

1,Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could but the server did not create cursors of that size. Investigation showed that some X servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware - a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK while a Sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. Actually the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this behavior correct? I'd really like to see a 2000x2000 cursor! -- Richard Neitzel thor@thor.atd.ucar.edu          Torren med sitt skjegg National Center For Atmospheric Research        lokkar borni under sole-vegg Box 3000 Boulder CO 80307-3000	                Gjo'i med sitt shinn 303-497-2057                                    jagar borni inn.

1,Dear Xperts I'm developing an application that uses a Motif slider to select an image file out of a directory. Now I would like to display the name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale button (i.e. with the MB1 pressed). As XmNshowValue only displays the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding image file name I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do the mapping between the scale value and the file name: XtAddEventHandler(scaleImageButton1MotionMask  FALSE SliderMoved NULL); and in the eventhandler do a: while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display event->window MotionNotify &Return)) ; XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage&value); /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/ However when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks with of co urse a null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button. So what is goin g wrong? Or is the a wrong approach to this problem? Any hints are highly appreciated. --- Phil

1,I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2. I am having the following 2 problems. (1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like /**/#This is a makefile at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive. However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines that This is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix. (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK. If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions I would appreciate information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps this is solved in a later version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also do you know of other cpp's that behave similarly? Since I do not have easy access to News a response to 'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.

1,The multi-lingual archives at The Computing Research Labs New Mexico State University will be moving to a new ftp address soon.  The archives are being put under control of the Consortium for Lexical Research. The new ftp address will be: clr.nmsu.edu (the current IP address is 128.123.1.12 but may change so use clr.nmsu.edu whenever possible). Please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crl.nmsu.edu and clr.nmsu.edu.  The crl.nmsu.edu site will be our ftp site for items not related to the Consortium for Lexical Research. The Arabic Chinese French Italian Indian Japanese Korean Tibetan and Vietnamese archives will all be moved. We will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once the archives have been moved. Please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to either crl.nmsu.edu or clr.nmsu.edu.  It will take a few days to move everything. If you are not familiar with our multi-lingual archives we have been slowly collecting various software fonts and text for different languages over the past 2 years.  Most of the software is currently Unix oriented.  We would also like to encourage people to continue to contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and quantity of multi-lingual tools. If you have an item to contribute please put it in: clr.nmsu.edu:incoming/ and send a note to lexical@nmsu.edu telling them about your contribution.

1,try this after XCreateWindow: ----------------------------- #include <X11/Xutil.h> Display display; Window window; { XSizeHints *xsizehints = XAllocSizeHints (); xsizehints->flags = USPosition | USSize;	/* or = PPosition | PSize */ xsizehints->x = 42; xsizehints->y = 42; xsizehints->width = 100; xsizehints->height = 100; XSetWMNormalHints (display window xsizehints); XFree (xsizehints); } These hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these values. If you use xsizehints->flags = PPosition | PSize this tells the window manager that the values are prefered values of the program not the user. I don't know a window manager that doesn't place the window like you prefer if you specify the position and size like above. Greetings from Berlin Tobias (bading@cs.tu-berlin.de)
1,Does anyone know what is available in terms of automated testing of X/Motif applications. I am thinking of a system which I could program (or which could record events/output) with our verification test procedures and then run/rerun each time we do regression testing. I am interested in a product like this for our UNIX projects and for a separate project which will be using OpenVMS. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Mark D.

However you may simply be able to pull the motherboard and set the HI-RES jumper (located in the same jumper array as the jumpers for the RAM/SIMM selects and Ethernet connection) and be happily on your way.  When you pull the motherboard the jumpers are in the left-rear (e.g. north-west) quadrant of the motherboard (to the left of the SIMM sockets).

1,I want to press a function key and have a text string appear in an XmText widget.  When I put *XmText.Translations: #augment \n\ <Key>F1:  insert-string(HELLO) in my resource file the translation doesn't happen.  If I put *XmText.Translations: <Key>F1:  insert-string(HELLO) in the file I get the text string HELLO when F1 is pressed but no other keys work which makes sense since the default translation mode is replace. Do I have a syntax problem here or something deeper? ..Bill Massena (wam3090@yak.boeing.com)

1,A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set up an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once.  This helped.  However I am still having some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program.  In the actual program I am writing a library callable from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is called it must initialize things and after that it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function. #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> void bla(XtAppContext app Widget top) { Widget topone = top;		// in real prog these are member vars XtAppContext theapp = app;	// of a class int junk = 0; Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp NULL NULL NULL NULL 0 &junk NULL); Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(blaaa xmPushButtonWidgetClass topone XmNheight 50 XmNwidth 50 NULL); XtRealizeWidget(topone); for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when Exit button clicked { XEvent event; XtAppNextEvent(theapp &event); XtDispatchEvent(&event); } XtDestroyWidget(box); XtCloseDisplay(dis); } // SetItUp - should be called once only void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app Widget *top) { int junk = 0; (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app test NULL 0 &junk NULL NULL NULL 0); } // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit() { static XtAppContext app;	// use these every time called static Widget top; static int setup = 0; if (!setup) { SetItUp(&app &top); setup = 1; } bla(app top); } // main - program which links to my library main() { for (int i=0;i<=20;i++) { doit(); printf(sleeping...\n);//widget still on screen at this point sleep(5); } } The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created. (It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the sleep in the main prog despite the XtDestroyWidget call). Anyone see something I'm missing? Thanks very much.

1,I posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply and now we have another bug report on the same subject. Can anybody help me out? How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one menu entry. In ORA Vol. 6 in the section on accelerators it says For information on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4... this is so you know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to Vol. 4 it says Likewise if a modifier is specified there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For example the translation: Shift<Key>q:	quit() will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as the Shift key (and the q key). This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to Ctrl<Key>o should do what I want but it doesn't it doesn't work if the user presses the control key the shift key and the o key. Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you can't use XtInstallAccelerators(). I am using Motif 1.1.3 on a DECstation 5000 but I have also tried it on an HP using Motif 1.1.3 and 1.2. -- ********************************************************************** Steve Dennis              Internet: sdennis@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com Software Engineer         Applicon Inc.

1,I'm an new to this.  Having found some files (public) to look into I ftp'ed them to a system I have access to.  I then used kermit to transmit them via modem to my host computer a PC-based file system.  I access internet through modem access to a university mainframe.  From the PC file server I pull the files to a disk and then pull them from disk to a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet).  When I try to uncompress and un-tar the files they either come out as garbage or I get an error in the tar process about directories being invalid. What I'm wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files (compressed binaryascii) about multiple platforms.  My guess is that it is the copy to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up.  Any help is appreciated. bob

1,I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure events are handled. I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a fake Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data. Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way? Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

1,Hi.  I've looked in the FAQ and the O-Reilly books and was unable to find (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as CapsLock and NumLock.  I can certainly track the events inside of my window and set a boolean there but what if CapsLock is pressed in another window?  I looked at XGrabKey() and decided it was definitely NOT what I wanted to do.  I could find no convenience function to tell me that information. My question is this:  Is there a means of determining what the state of CapsLock and/or NumLock is? An even more pointed question: Is there an easy means of making an X keyboard act like a PC keyboard?  ie CapsLock is active and the user presses shift-a I'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'A'. Any input is greatly appreciated. Please respond via email.  I will repost a summary of my findings. Thanks Ralph
1,store and reply of mouse and keyboard events -------------------------------------------- To produce regression tests or automatic demo's we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events produced by a user. It should be possible to filter the mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue an to store them in a file. This sequence of events stored in a file should be given to the server's queue as if a user is working. 1. Exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all mouse and keyboard events (where)? 2. Where one can catch these events to store them ? In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal (HP). Where can we catch all events coming from a given server. If this is not possible can we catch all events given to a certain client and how ? 3. Where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ? Is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ? Thanks in advance Ron.
1,Hi I'm new to this group so please bear with me! Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView. I put together a quick test and I've found that XPutImage() is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that: (1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or (2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is what is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)? All help appreciated...thanks! Derek ----------------------------------------------------------- | Derek C.

1,Hello This is my first net letter so forgive mistakes! I have been plagued by problems (or lack of info) with authorization in Open Windows 3.0 for a long while and would like some help please!  I generally use strait MIT X and so don't use OW much but when I share X software with others - bad news. PROBLEM: My friend who logs into his SSII trys to run my program that runs fine on my machine however my friend gets client not authorized to connect to server (or something close).  If OW is started with the -noauth option all is well but surely this is not required in general! Also xhost + does not work becoming root does not work etc... Any help will be greatly appreciated! Thanx send replies to neuralog@neosoft.com or this news group
1,# #I have a question regarding the processing of program arguments #such as the -geometry option. Since this is a standard X option #I'm wondering wether I have to parse it manually or whether there #is some predefined function that will do this for me? # If you are using the Intrinsics it is parsed for you.  If you are working at the Xlib level you can parse it yourself or you can use the following bit of code. static XrmOptionDescRec options[] = { {-geometry	.geometry	XrmoptionSepArg (XPointer)NULL} }; #define Number(x)	(sizeof(x)/sizeof(x[0])) XrmParseCommand(db options Number(options) MyApplication &argc argv); Then use XrmGetResource() to retrieve the value and parse it using XParseGeometry(). It is probably quicker to parse it yourself from argv however I much prefer using the X resource management routines to do this. Patrick L.

Using XPutImage your source is maintained by the client and the destination is maintained by the server thus you incur the overhead of transporting through whatever client-server communications mechanism you are using. Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps? These are maintained by the server so copying them into a window is much cheaper. Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs or running in XSynchonize mode. -- -paul	pmartz@dsd.es.com Evans & Sutherland

What it may think is right may be exactly what the user wants. Assuming that your application has reason to know better is IMHO anti-social.

You are right but PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.  It makes my brain hurt. USPosition and USSize should ONLY be set if the USER specified the position and size.

1,Hi there netters I require a window to appear at a co-ordinates (00) (top left corner) of my screen (root window). Could some windows guru out there help me on how to go about doing this. I write the whole program which creates the window with the image it displays - I require the image to appear at the top-left corner so that I can grab it for recording on to video using a MIniVas controller which expects the window at the same spot every time.

1,[again poseted for a friend] Okay I got such great response from my last question (thanks everyone) lets try again: How can I tell if a colorcell is read-only? I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once I start running out of allocatable cells using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color. Once I determine if a cell is read-only I assume I can then just request an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application. So far the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors once my colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable. But life would be much easier if I could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly... Any ideas? Noel (ngorelic@speclab.cr.usgs.gov)

1,Hello... I wonder if some one can suggest an answer to the following question: I am a total X novice and would appreciate any suggestions you may have. I am trying to create a simple drawing tool.... __________ |        | |     ___|___ |_____|__|  | |	   | |_____| Let's say I have two rectangles on the canvas(see above) one intersecting the other... Now I would like to delete one of the rectangles. The way I do it is to create another GC wherein I use the GXxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes. A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white which is something that should be avoided. Is there any way I can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other rectangle too? I also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area as this degrades performance very badly... Thank you... Gopal

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following platforms: SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) IBM (AIX 3.2) Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.3 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1 and GCC). DEC Ultrix. DEC Alpha AXP (OSF/1). Documentation is available online. Changes since 0.13 include: o Added new resource gethostbynameIsEvil for Sun's that coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what their own names are. (Command-line flag is -ghbnie.) o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view window is closed for window managers too dull to do so themselves. o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's. o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. o Added 'Clear' button to Open box to allow more convenient cut-n-paste entries of URL's. o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False new document view windows will not be automatically positioned by the program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how they're placed). o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new resource initialWindowIconic can also be used). o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed. o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not right for authors and readers can't do anything about bad images in any case). o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed. o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns. o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'. o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's. o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy dana@thumper.bellcore.com). o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com). o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk). o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy bingle@cs.purdue.edu). o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups. Comments questions and bug reports should be sent to mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  Thanks in advance for any feedback you can provide.

Hi I'm new to this group so please bear with me! Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView. I put together a quick test and I've found that XPutImage() is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that: (1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or (2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both!

Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some documentation.

1,I'm running X under openwindows 3.

Sorry but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position and the window at a position below it. This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current configuration and restore is later. Currently my solution is: XCreateWindow(...); XSetWMProperties(..); XMapWindow(...); XFlush(...); XMoveWindow(...); It works with olwm but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering if I'm overlooking something obvious. Richard.
1,Usually when I start up an application I first get the window outline on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry option the window appears right away the properties specified by the -geometry argument. The question now is: How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window size and position but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

1,A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation. When he first logs on (via xdm) he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However if he opens up a second xterm application suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font. The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour and more significant ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option) no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables. Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best does anyone have any ideas? More info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe) with the most current operating system and running X11R5. It is not mwm's fault as the same problems occur under twm etc.
1,I have a problem when I'm using PostScript. When I am working local on a SUN SPARCstaton IPC the PostScript works good but when I connect to the SUN from a X-terminal I just get error messages that the PostScript cannot connect to the news-display. Why doesn't PostScript work on an X-terminal? Is there any way to make it work? Henrik Henrik Hjort Hjort

1,Hello I am testing a port of X11R5 to Coherent a unix clone OS for Intel architecture machines.  I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple terminal emulator program). The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the server for display one at a time.  The characters appear to be too closely spaced with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the rightmost edge of the first character then the 3rd character destroys the rightmost edge of the second character and so on.  It looks like there is an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous character.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual characters. If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be or where I should look to find it it would be much appreciated.

Can anybody help me out? The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers which is exactly what would be desired in this case: Ctrl Any<Key>q. >In ORA Vol. 6 in the section on accelerators it says For information >on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4... this is so you >know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.

For >example the translation: >	Shift<Key>q:	quit() >will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as >the Shift key (and the q key). This is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If you're a Motif implementor I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations. >Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? If you mean menu accelerator no it's not possible.  That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page. >Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you >can't use XtInstallAccelerators(). I can't think of a reason why not. >How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of >case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one >menu entry. There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget] set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell shell). For example applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade -- filePulldown - openPushbutton - exitPushbutton *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\ Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton ArmAndActivate)\n\ Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton ArmAndActivate) You have to write and add the application action PerformAction which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments. I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time I used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me but the more general approach I described above should work. -- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)

It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between frames and use tvtwm my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help on this group!) However I may have colormap questions later.....

There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the X11R5 distribution. Actually I just finished writing a motif animation program... (take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side they were just about equal. The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps). Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?) and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs) so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one). In short: allowing all three forms of display within the program is a Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network) and let the user pick whatever feels fastest. (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :) )Rob
1,I want to be able to send a Pixmap from one client to the next. Along with this I want to send the Colormap and foreground and background pixel values.  So far not a problem I can do this with no problem. However once I have the Pixmap id and the Colormap id how do I go about telling the server that the second (receiving) client now wants to have associations with the two id's? TIA John -- o  John L.

1,I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window manager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough I have other xterm windows underneath them with exactly the same positioning. In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles here's a crude picture: ====================== Figure 1 ==================================== | |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+ |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C + |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+ |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C but + |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  + |    +      window window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     + |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+ | ====================== Figure 1 ==================================== Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need since I also insist on having a virtual WM. The only problem is that the title location is static that is  it is configured in .twmrc and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming. Therefore I have implemented f.squeeze{ left center right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button you can change this: +---------+ + title A + +------------------------+ +   this is the          + +     body of the        + +      window window A  + +------------------------+ to this: +---------+ + title A + +------------------------+ +   this is the          + +     body of the        + +      window window A  + +------------------------+ =============== Okay. So far so good. Now how the heck do I get them to put this into the next official twm and the next tvtwm and the next vtwm and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of? One way would be to post in comp.windows.x a description of this enhancement together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing and hope that someone reads it. :-) In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing look back up at Figure 1 and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter the result is: +=========+   +---------+   +=========+ + title B +   + title A +   + title C + +-------------------------------------+ +   this is the body of the window   + +   window A which is on top.        + +-------------------------------------+ =================== The rest of this posting explains how to implement it based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long. The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c: #ifdef SHAPE case F_SQUEEZELEFT: {	static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT 0 0 }; if (DeferExecution (context func Scr->SelectCursor)) return TRUE; tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze; SetFrameShape( tmp_win ); break; } .... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif ( Of course you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h and add { f.squeezeleft FKEYWORD F_SQUEEZELEFT } ... and so forth ... to parse.c In order to use these functions add something like the following to your .twmrc file: Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter ================= About a year ago I posted this but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out. Since then blast has appeared in comp.sources.x Volume 19 Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title. Better to have a twm-style window manager I think. -- Ralph Betza (FM) uunet!ssiny!gnohmon         gnohmon@ssiny.com The question of whether a computer can swim is more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can think - Lenny Dykstra
1,| | Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu | Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some | documentation. Is this method likely to give better results than server- | resident pixmaps? I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code | mentioned above... There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory and if so how efficiently the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!). I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write) If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower depending on your OS's implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device. One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them. One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that in its sample implementation there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden violent death (e.g. kill).  You have to be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments. Ken -- Kenneth Whaley			 (408) 748-6347 Kubota Pacific Computer Inc.

1,Hi Xperts! I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition. previously i was able to run all x-windows applications  and then i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that  the hard disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. My immediate alternative was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted in not loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded. I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw. In a desperate effort to regain x-windows i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files from the tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi 75dpi and misc. when i run xinit the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the default path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no disk space. Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a 1.5 GB disk and load openwindows  to just have my x-windows running. Thanks Pramod --
1,Can anyone give me some information please ... I need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX platform. Do I need the Motif private header files and source or can I make do with the public headers that are provided? Motif includes Xt in this context. One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have already written I am sure) and would therefore be probably be a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class. Is this more difficult (in principle not lines of code)? Alternatively if anyone has a multi-column list widget they could sell me this might save me from having to write one! Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not yet have the spec)? Answers appreciated Nicholas. -- Nicholas Young (+44 71 637 9111)

1,I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with XCreateColormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit display.  When I move the cursor over the window I get the Technicolor Effect - which is fine.  Basically my program works. My problem/question is: When I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user for some input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set to XmDIALOG_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_MODAL.  The result is that if my cursor is over the dialogShell I get my colormap but if the cursor is over the applicationShell (or any window other than the dialogShell) I get the default colormap.  But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_ window of my application I get my colormap. Any suggestions?  Thanks david

If I were writing an interface to keyboard accelerators I would have one resource called accelerators that took a translation table period. I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work to get the accelerators installed.  As soon as the end-user specified one it would be active and automatically installed. To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like: *menuItem.accelerators: #override \n\ Ctrl<Key>M:	fire() \n\ Shift<Key>L:	fire() \n The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would automatically see a Ctrl M show up in your menuItem object.

First I create the shared memory segment attach the client attach the X server and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man pages on removing of shared memory segments you will see that the segment only dies after all attachments are gone. Now if the client dies that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you) and since the X server notices the client has dies frees up it's resources including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more shared memory segment. Terrible but it works. Regards Richard Gooch....

1,I am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics and imagery.  The user of the widget will be able to specify when creating it whether it is to operate in X or GL mode. I have set up translations and actions to handle mouse button presses.  They work fine when the widget is in X mode.  In GL mode they only work when the widget (my GL/X widget) is a child of a manager.  Put another way the translations do not work when the widget is configured in GL mode and is a child of a shell.  Does anyone know why this is happening? Thanks in advance. Bruce Gendler bgendler@csc.com

Unfortunately it appears that the NumLock mask varies from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and which are for Meta (Mod1Mask Mod2Mask Mod3Mask Mod4Mask Mod5Mask). eg SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock whereas Solaris 1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any given server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance. Thanks Ralph
1,I have the March/April version of the X Journal open in front of me. I'll be working on programming x-clients this summer and since I don't have much experience with programming X I thought this issue might be helpful as it has a section on debugging and a section on the 40 most common errors in programming X. At the end of the errors section there are the following references for tutorials on X programming style.  They are: Rosenthal David -   A simple X11 client program Proceedings of the Winter 1988 Usenix Conference 1988. Lemke D. and Rosenthal D. -  Visualizing X11 clients Proceedings of the Winter 1989 Usenix Conference 1989. Does anyone know where I could find these in printed or (preferably) electronic form? Or can you suggest any net resources devoted to the introduction to programming X (I'll be looking at the bookstore for books so I am really only asking about what I can find on the net.) Thanks David Simpson davesimp@soda.berkeley.edu

1,Hi folks Say I'm new to R5 and have one quick question. In using xon ( xon  <machine_name> )   I notice that it always comes up with a very small window .  I'm pretty sure its the default font.  My xterms all work normally. Is xon supposed to read your .Xresources for a font size ? xrdb -q appears to show the right stuff. I can use xon with arguments such as  xterm -fn 10x20    etc and everything is correct.  Of course you could always do a simple script to do this  but I have a feeling I'm missing something simple here. Comments / suggestions appreciated. Thanks in advance Bob bshaw@spdc.ti.com    mm

Hear! Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around etc.  But for most work the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.) I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced. All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than DOS). -- \---------------------------------------------------------------------/ \ Seth Buffington 	U.S.S.

1,QUESTION: What is the EXACT entry (parameter and syntax please) in the X-Terminal configuration file (loaded when the X-Terminal boots) to add another system to the TCP/IP access control list? BACKGROUND: I have two unix systems 1. an AT&T 3B2 running X11R3 and MIT's X11R4 and 2. a Sun SS10 without any X. I want to have a window to the Sun and the 3B2 on the NCD X-Terminal at the same time.  I can do this if I manually set the Network Parameter TCP/IP Access Control List to off then login to my telnet session. Not Great! I've tried to get xhost to work and failed.  Either my syntax is wrong or the X11R3 implementation is bogus. I am trying to edit the NCD configuration file that is loaded when the NCD boots.  No matter what entry I add or edit the NCD still boots with the TCP/IP Access Control list containing only the 3B2. My manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated!!  Thanks!

1,I am in the process of installing X11R5 on my Sun Sparcstation 2 and have run into a problem.  I imagine it has something to do with a missing screen driver or something along those lines but figured someone out there in Internet land might be able to help. I am installing it on a machine that already has OpenLook installed and would like to have both installed concurrently.  Thus I set it up to compile to my /usr/X11R5 directory.  I worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (with gcc) so that it compiles without any warnings.  I need it installed for PEX-SI so I set all those appropriate flags.  When I run it however I get a message along the lines of: Getting interface configuration : Operation not supported on socket sunOpenFrameBuffer : Inappropriate ioctl for device Fatal server error : no screens found Any ideas on how I can fix it?

1,I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2. I am having the following 2 problems. (1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like /**/#This is a makefile at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive. However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines that This is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix. (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK. If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions I would appreciate information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps this is solved in a later version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also do you know of other cpp's that behave similarly? Since I do not have easy access to News a response to 'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.

All this leaves me wondering if I'm overlooking something obvious. Richard. I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for the border of a window or for the user window. Maybe other window managers have similar options. Another way to figure out the difference between the user window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their positions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this way. Greeting Tobias (bading@cs.tu-berlin.de)

You'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each modifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier you want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only way to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock modifier). I don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous assignments either. (ie. what if NumLock is mapped for more then one modifier). I suppose first found is as good as any. X doesn't handle locking modifiers that well. Hope that helps Dave Lapp Standard Disclaimer etc...

Can someone help me? Unfortunately the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example the sequence ESC [ 1 B 7 would indicate that the HOME key was pressed with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers such as shift-Return. If anybody wants these changes they're welcome to them but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file x11term.c.  Maybe if someone at OSF is interested I can send them the tweaks but I imagine they've got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest I'll post the mods somewhere although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it. Notes: * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual. * The patches I made were to version 18.58 under Sun OS 4.1.2 [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could easily be adapted for anything else. +-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+ | Mark Lanzo   KD4QLZ  lanzo@tekelec.com   919-460-5576 |    \\\///       | +-------------------------------------------------------+---- \XX/ -------+

Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so I haven't seen the FAQ lately to check.] Two ways: 1) When you start the xterm you can use command line options: -n ICON_NAME           To set the icon label -T WINDOW_TITLE        To set the window title -title WINDOW_TITLE    Equivalent to -T WINDOW_TITLE 2) You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly: The basic escape sequence is: ESC ] <P> ; <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> BEL where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters <P> is an ASCII decimal digit -- '2' '1' or '0' depending on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title or both and <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> is your desired label string. Hence this command will set the window & icon title: echo \033]0;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c To set just the icon title: echo \033]1;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c To set just the window title: echo \033]2;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c Of course you may have to fiddle with exact syntax depending on how the echo command works on your system and what shell you are using (I've shown System-V semantics under Bourne or Korn shells). [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.  Otherwise you'll have to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string instead of using convenient octal sequences.] If you want your titlebar updated continously say to show your current directory hostname or somesuch then you'll have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands. Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence in the prompt string itself sometimes not ... +-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+ | Mark Lanzo   KD4QLZ  lanzo@tekelec.com   919-460-5576 |    \\\///       | +-------------------------------------------------------+---- \XX/ -------+

For Gouroud a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage() what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.

1,Does anyone know the difference between MOOLIT and OLIT?  Does Sun support MOOLIT?  Is MOOLIT available on Sparcstations? I have recntly downloaded a copy of wkshTree written by Eric Wallengren of Univel.  There are many widgets that are apparently available only to MOOLIT but not OLIT. Is there a wkshTree program available under OLIT? steved@cfcl.com

Thanks for this clue and thanks to Derek Ho also for a pointer in the same direction. One solution due to Derek Ho: when the popup is popped up we SetValue its location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the previous popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue first and only using SetValue if the required location is different. The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup so that the SetValue really does change the location of the popup. (We tried this just for a double check on the source of the problem.) The solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows: 1) Use twm or mwm rather than olwm 2) Use olwm with resource *wmTimeout: 10 3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed. This is obviously working around some bug somewhere. Thanks -- Chris Ho-Stuart
1,I am working on an X-Window based application that needs to override some of the window manager focus processing.  I am using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently although I will also be working with Open Look in the future. What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the user from switching from one window of the application to another window.  Let's say for example that Window A is on top of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally if the user clicks the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window A. From the research and testing I've done so far it appears that this window ordering is handled by the window manager in this case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping notify events but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the switch. The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch in those cases when the switch is not allowed I manually force the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places twice. Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this newsgroup. Cheers....

1,Hello--  I'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as X.  A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at UNC-Chapel Hill.  While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design currently we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an X-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit budget. Unfortunately I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the various X FAQs or X manuals that I've seen.  Does anyone have some type of frequency data like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines and things of that sort?  Or barring that a program that records requests to the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself? Any and all help would be very appreciated. Many thanks ---Mark =============================================================================== Mark A. DeLoura       deloura@cs.unc.edu      U of North Carolina Chapel Hill

Remember the default colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal mwm won't allow keyboard focus onto your main shell and so it won't allow cmap focus either. Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer I suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way the cmap focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus but will beat its own path. (if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit you can set cmap focus explicit also but you then need a binding to f.focus_color probably on MB1). -- David Brooks					dbrooks@osf.org Open Software Foundation			uunet!osf.org!dbrooks Showres soote my foote
1,I am considering making a reasonably large application for free distribution (probably copylefted).  I am going to use X.  Now I'm bewildered by the huge number of standards that open systems has created. I've lived in a fairly tookit-sheltered environment.  Most of the tools here were produced with the Athena Widget set or X Intrinsics or Xw (??). In my humble opinion they look like crap.  I don't know however if this is a characteristic of the tookits or just poor aestetic taste in the programmers. I would like my app to look a little more sculptured like mwm.  I understand however that mwm isn't free like the other tookits. I am getting Linux so I will have InterViews but I don't know how it will look.  I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF but I don't know what it looks like either. If you can help explain this toolkit mess to me I would be much obliged.  Which are free?  Which are the best?  Which are portable?  Which looks nice?  Which is not a resource hog? Also if you happen to know which are available on Linux and/or Sun that would be a big help too. Thanks in advance.

1,Has anyone found a fix for the following problem? Client Software:	SunOs 4.1.1 X11R5 Server Hardware:	Sun IPC Server Software:	SunOs 4.1.1 Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37) A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers (including MIT X11R5 Xsun DecWindows Tektronix X terminal) has no problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users. I have tried the following things: 1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch (100444-37). 2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm. 3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110). This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method) and screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help but I was still able to get the application to hang. Repeat By: This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times. Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up) Click and release on a menu item Repeat until application hangs Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. -- Skip Koppenhaver skip@eco.twg.com

1,Not being an Xt programmer by any stretch of the imagination this is driving me crazy and it's probably really simple to do. I need to make a composite widget that does nothing at all but is merely a placeholder in a widget instance heirarchy -- allowing me an additional resource name level. To illustrate I have an application with the following widget heirarchy: Shell Widget | Application Widghet I want the following: Shell Widget | Intermediate Widget | Application Widget where the intermediate widget has a name but gets all its other properties (and propagates down new values) from the shell widget. I assume there's a simple way to do this but I can't find an example and the documentation I have is rather vague about implementing composite widgets. Please respond via email.

1,Is there a PD version of cfb or other PD server stuff which has a colour frame buffer implementation which works in bitplaned mode i.e. where the screen memory is grouped so that bit 0 of every pixel is here bit 1 is there etc. The only such beast I know if at the moment is the GfxBase server for the Commodore Amiga and it is commercial.

1,I was planning to use the following pipe to move some display data to a system that has a color hardcopy unit: xwd | xwud -display hostname:0.0 I had tested it with some simple windows like the OpenWindows file manager and it worked fine but when I tried it with a more complex (larger) image the xwd part blew up with a segmentation fault.  I tried it without the pipe by redirecting xwd's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud and got the same error from xwud.  If I had to guess it seems like it's running out of memory but this happened on a SPARC 10 with 64 megs 128 meg swap space and only one user with minimal activity.  The file was about 3 MB. This verion of xwd/xwud was supplied with the Sun OpenWindows 3.0 distribution which I believe corresponds to X11 R4. Any ideas?

1,Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets. These are good tools but they are 1) heavy 2) hard to find when you need one 3) limited in their software expandibility 4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis 5) cannot be remotely operated and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS requiring much manual manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump but we found it 1) too difficult for most people 2) did not have enough information for many protocols 3) could not be used interactively 4) could not handle TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols and could be easily modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features. Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump. It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will need Motif 1.1 or better. The following files are available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking tcpview-1.0.tar.Z	tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z	Sun4 binaries tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z	DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries What tcpview adds to tcpdump: - easier interface - enhanced protocol decoding - hex display of frame - capture based on time number of frames or user interrupt - can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name - ethernet address host table - can easily follow a stream highlighting out-of-order frames - can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional processing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1 New features: Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r' the file type will be automatically detected. Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file. The hex format has been changed. New time options have been added. Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets. Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag) New flags: -R	read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed except for reading from stdin -ttt	prints delta times -tttt	prints times relative to the first frame -W	write a Sniffer save file (use with -w) -x	print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.

1,We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System. The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n facility. As you know there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi. Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system. In order to do that the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with ASCII and Kanji mixed for example is given each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese' each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1 jisx0208 or so. We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is. We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably used Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'. //I18N.h // This may look like C code but it is really -*- C++ -*- // $Id: I18N.hv 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $ #ifndef _I18N_H #define _I18N_H #include <X11/Xlib.h> extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str	/* IN */ int wc_len		/* IN */ char *buf		/* OUT */ int *buflen		/* IN/OUT */ int *scanned_len	/* OUT */ char **charset);	/* OUT */ extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc); #endif /* _I18N_H */ //I18N.cc /* $Id: I18N.ccv 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */ #include <stdlib.h> #include <X11/Xlibint.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include I18N.h extern C { #include <X11/wchar.h> #define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs #define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid #include Xlocaleint.h #undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #undef _Xmbfscs #undef _Xmbctidtocsid extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale const wchar_t* int char* int* int* int*); extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale _CSID); extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale _CSID); }; int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str/* IN */ int wc_len		/* IN */ char *buf		/* OUT */ int *buf_len		/* IN/OUT */ int *scanned_len	/* OUT */ char **charset)	/* OUT */ { XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert(); int ctid; int status; Charset *xcharset; status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale wc_str wc_len buf buf_len scanned_len &ctid); if (status == Success) { xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale ctid)); *charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL; } else *charset = NULL; return status; } ---------------- An included file above Xlocaleint.h is also Xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled. A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01. When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing: _Xmbctidtocsid (code) _Xmbfscs (code) _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code) _XFallBackConvert (code) We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used its internal functions. The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented. We observe from HP's libX11.a they used some Ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and therefore finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not seem to lead us a solution. My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? If it is a public function that is perfect but even if it is not we want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5. In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. Any help or comments would be highly appreciated. I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area even if it is not HP's implementation. Thank you. -- Takeshi Inoue inoue@crd.yokogawa.co.jp Yokogawa Electric Corporation Open Systems Laboratory	0422(52)5557

As I've said before there's no reliable way to find out the size of the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented you can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the root will work in most cases but there's no guarantee that the outside decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm). -- Tom LaStrange        toml@boulder.ParcPlace.COM

In fact doing man X on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you: The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used when referring to this software: X X Window System X Version 11 X Window System Version 11 X11 There is no such thing as X Windows or X Window despite the repeated misuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME of the window system right why should one trust anything else they have to say? With regard to dialup X11 implementations there are several.  You can buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies including both GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact I'm composing this from an NCD running X11 over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.) NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such software packages available. X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX) and is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard there will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various sorts of hardware.

1,Hi ! I am using Xview 3.0 on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board from Parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. I am having some problems utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter. I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use to display live video. My video input is 24 bit color. The problem is that my top level frame created as frame = (Frame) xv_create(NULLFRAMENULL); seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas. I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits. I tried using the following Xlib code : XVisualInfo visual_info; int depth = 24; Colormap colormap; XSetWindowAttributes attribs; unsigned long valuemask = 0; Window *win; Xv_opaque frame; win = xv_get(frameXV_XID); XMatchVisualInfo(displayscreendepthTrueColor&visual_info); /* So far so good */ colormap = XCreateColormap(displaywinvisual_infoAllocNone); /* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */ attribs.colormap = colormap; valuemask |= CWColormap; XChangeWindowAttributes(displaywvaluemask&attribs); XSetWindowColormap(displaywincolormap); Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ? Thanks in advance for any help that I can get.

It looks like the following: xmodmap keymapfile mwm I think that the problem has to do with a conflict between function keys F1 through F7 which already have assigned functions (e.g. Move Minimize etc). The odd thing is that I don't see these errors if I run xmodmap keymapfile from an xterm. Can anyone suggest a way to modify the key map specifically F1 through F7 AND not have mwm (Motif Window Manager) complain.

1,Hi looking for any advice or suggestions about a problem I'm having with MIT X11R5's editres in particular under twm variants. For a start 9 times out of 10 (but NOT always) editres won't grab a widget tree when running on our NCD (Decwindows) Xterms which I'm told will be fixed when the R5 (not R4) XDm is installed. OK so I tried running it on a Sun running real R5 on the same network - I get a widget tree but it's ALWAYS for 'TWM Icon Manager' Anybody know of any patches for (a) twm or (b) editres that I should look at? Thanks K
1,Hi Xperts this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-( I can't believe there is no XView wizards any more 8-)... I'm using sliders in my XView apps usually with editable numeric field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by PANEL_MAX_VALUE! As I understand PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items doesn't work in the case of slider despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit: /* Panel_multiline_text_item Panel_numeric_text_item * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes */ PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM			 152) PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT		 182) which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute and returns value 0. Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space in a text fields but not Sun's Xview... Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me and clear this problem? Any help is very much appreciated. Yuri yuri@uk.ac.hw.phy
1,I'm writing an X server for some video-generation equipment.  The hardware is truecolor in YUV space; in X terms it has a 24-bit static color visual.  I would really like to have the server just present this static visual but I'm not sure if this will be acceptable to most X clients.  The three problems I see are: 1) The colormap though huge is static. 2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide. 3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space the translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error. Being more of a server guy than a client guy I ask: will these limitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff floating around blithely accept what they're given?  I could write the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of e.g. 8 bits but I'd rather avoid this if not necessary. I know there are no absolutes but I'd appreciate hearing people's opinions and suggestions.  Thanks! -- Frederick G. M.

1,See subject. An opportunity for sales-people (-persons? -entities?). I am looking for a commercial/PD graphics editor with fairly limited abilities that runs under X and preferably uses Motif widgets. It must run on HP-UX version 9 either with or without the PEX extension. The sort of things I want are simple drawing resizing and moving of objects such as lines rectangles and text. Bounding rectangle operations are sufficient for object selection. Ideally it should also allow the creation and placement of more complex objects such as widgets (e.g. text entry fields or labels) but this is not mandatory. Does anyone have such an animal? If you do please mail me with details including price (especially run-time licensing since it must be included in a product). Alternatively send glossies to me at Logica 68 Newman Street London W1 including technical info please. For PD stuff I have some effort that could be put into porting.

1,We recently got an NCD X-terminal to evaluate. This is running XRemote over a serial line. I wanted to get some measurement of response time so I wrote a small Xlib program which simply creates a window maps it and sends the first Expose event to itself. The program times the delay from sending the event to receiving it.  I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server round-trip delays. It's a similar concept to the ping(8C) program. Is this a valid test to perform ? I've also tried the xbench program available from ftp.uu.net which bombards the server with graphics operations but I just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is acceptable interactive response time. Has anyone got any ideas on this subject ? Thanks. Andrew. (afielden@mlsma.att.com) -- +----------------------------------------+----------------------------------+ |Andrew Fielden.

1,Does anybody have an X server for NT that they're willing to share files or experiences? Bill Steer Westinghouse
1,We have an old Sun3/60 here which gets occasional use.  When X11R5 is started on it any console messages during startup are undeletable.  After X is fully started we run an xterm as the console - the problem is that any messages that arrive before this starts go to the plain console.  Refresh window fails to remove them.  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of the screen obscuring anything else below them. At boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1. We're running X in color and I suspect that maybe the offending messages are on the B/W framebuffer and thereby not getting deleted. My question is: has anyone else seen this and is there an easy way to get rid of these messages? Please reply by e-mail to hughm@inmos.co.uk. Hugh McIntyre. INMOS Ltd. Bristol UK. (BTW: SunOS 4.0.3 X11R5 mwm). PS: I know I can redirect output of the relevant commands to /dev/null - I'm looking for a more general solution).

X allows the user to do bit arithmetic on pixel values (i.e.  XOR foreground and backgroun pixel values together to calculate a foreground color that when used with a function of GXxor fill change foreground to background and vice-versa). If your rounding does not preserve these types of calculations then clients that use them will break. Ken -- Kenneth Whaley			 (408) 748-6347 Kubota Pacific Computer Inc.

We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit TrueColor visual. The main problems we encountered were: 1) Clients written with logic like the following: if (DefaultDepth() != 1) /* Assume default depth is 8bit */ These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window to run correctly. 2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much and just outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class with a dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes but many clients don't bother to check they just start throwing XStoreColor calls at you. Though both are clearly client error this is the case with so many clients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a default root window visual than it ever would be for all these client writers to change their clients to do the right thing. -- -paul	pmartz@dsd.es.com Evans & Sutherland

I used to think this way and not just about X. For example incorrect English constructs such as its raining or it's window id annoy me. However there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!). On a related topic who is to say that color is more or less correct than colour - being Irish and hence using English English as opposed to American English I always use the latter except of course for API terms such as XAllocColor and colormap. In a world that uses the term Windows to refer to Microsoft Windows perhaps the time has come to accept X Windows as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than say the X Window System and let's face it almost everyone uses it. Ultimately we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect product recognition is important and a short snappy descriptive title (X is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called Microsoft Windows or the Microsoft Window System or how about just plain Microsoft! To summarise (or should that be summarize) the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be windowing system). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. Gerard O'Driscoll (gerard.odriscoll@dps.co.uk) Du Pont Pixel Systems Ltd.

Well yes and no.  I don't particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate but I do think it's worth pointing out that popular usage is not always sufficient excuse. In this case for example I think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or mispronounced your name would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably not. The same is true of X.  The X Window System X X11 and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name.  In fact some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point. As for the trade publications that promulgate things like X Window or X.windows or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by *journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  Would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong? Popular usage is as it may be but I for one am all for holding people who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness. >Indeed the fact that X won out over NeWS >was really down to popular opinion (I know we all think it's(!) technically >superior as well!). X11 technically superior to NeWS?  Well in *some* alternate universe perhaps ...

(We have not changed them.) *Submission extension*   We are still accepting papers. *Tutorial topic* _Converting Andrew source code to C++_ This tutorial will discuss the steps necessary to convert a site from C (extended with classC) to C++.  Conversion of the source code requires only a couple of steps: run the converter fill in missing type information Describing this will not take long.  The remainder of the day will be spent learning how to write objects in C++ and practicing. ------------------------------ 1993 Andrew Technical Conference and Consortium Annual Meeting June 24-25 1993 Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh PA The conference will be held on the last Thursday and Friday in June.  A tutorial will be on Thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the 25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the two days.  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting though only Consortium members will be able to vote. This year's theme is Application Construction by Non-Programmers Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer construction of applications.  There have however been some excellent UIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will consider questions such as What is needed for application construction by non-programmers? Can we avoid programming altogether or is a simple language needed? Is it sufficient to create applications or must users be able to create new widgets? Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves? Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System including applications experience with users new objects reviews of and proposals for revision of internal Andrew protocols We expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would like to do a demonstration. Paper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993. Acceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June. Send papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.

1,[Please accept the following announcement for comp.windows.x.announce. -gf] A completely revamped version of the X11 browser interface to Archie Xarchie is now available as export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/xarchie-2.0.tar.Z For those not familar with Archie or Xarchie I include part of the manpage intro: Xarchie is an X11 browser interface to the Archie Internet information system using the Prospero virtual filesystem protocol.  Archie provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp sites by examining directories returned as query matches and allows you to retrieve files located this way. Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4 R5 and a variety of other flavors of X and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the new features (from the README) follows: * Major improvements include: - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new features (FWF MultiList widget). - Ability to expand directories in browser. - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation. - Ability to save and reload query results as well as print them. - Ability to resort results and sort results by user-definable pseudo-weights. - Online help browser. - Color resources done so that they don't break mono displays. - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations. - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.

1,I am glad and proud to announce the new mailing-list for the PD Motif C++ bindings. I got over 40 replies in about one week of people interested in such a list and the software has now been properly installed so the list is now up and running. For those interested in joining please send e-mail to that extend to 'motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl' or 'rvloon@cv.ruu.nl'. The blurb everyone who joins gets follows as well as the original announcement for where Motif++ can be obtained. Enjoy! 8< - 8< - Welcome to the Motif++ Mailing List! The Motif++ mailing list is a mailing list dedicated to Motif++ the PD C++ wrapper library for Motif where people can ask questions about Motif++ swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. All requests of an administrative nature like subscription removal etc. should be directed to motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl All e-mail sent to motif++@cv.ruu.nl will be sent to the entire list so please make sure when using 'vacation' type programs that will reply to messages automatically that the address for the mailing-list is excluded from auto-replies. Enjoy! Ronald van Loon     | In theory there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice. 3DCV Group Utrecht | The Netherlands     | In practice however there is. 8< - 8< - Hello Motif World over the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to the Motif++ bindings. Imake support has been improved a few defaults have been changed and a lot of other small things have been added. This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz and possibly will support X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x. Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this distribution (during off-peak hours) and delete all previous copies. Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT: HISTORY The University of Lowell supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation has developed a wrapper-library that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++ classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through member-functions while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1. However the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights and only worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings the bindings are no longer actively supported by the University of Lowell. I Ronald van Loon at a certain point last year have taken the Lowell bindings fixing the bugs I came across adding missing memberfunctions and enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC). NEW RELEASE I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++ bindings. This release offers: - Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support - Support for Xbae widgetset - Two additional widgets written by myself that can be used to indicate progress in an application. - Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake and its config files on your site. I have tried to provide the bindings with a standard Makefile tweakable for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude of platforms to test the Imake-files on. - Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs) - An article I wrote on the usage of Motif X and C++ previously posted on Usenet. WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS Ftp: Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1) directory /pub/X11. Note: Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large files during working hours. Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this is an old version of the bindings. E-mail: Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail and I will send the bindings by e-mail. REQUEST Those who use the bindings and find bugs or see room for improvement please contact me and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of bugs a bug-fix of course ;-). MORE INFORMATION Contact me at rvloon@cv.ruu.nl. If you are desperate then you can call me at +31 30 506711 (that is Utrecht the Netherlands; those within the Netherlands call 030-506711).

1,The XView version 3 source distribution included in the contrib section of X11R5 included the source to the textedit program.  I'd like to take the sources and modify them to add support for a ToolTalk-like message server and maybe for ToolTalk while I'm at it since the Sun-supplied textedit binary doesn't seem to speak tooltalk. However the sources in the R5 contrib area seem to be for an older version of textedit than the version shipped with OpenWindows 3.  For example the OWN 3.0 textedit includes drag and drop support and a dropsite in the main control area while the source in contrib/xview knows nothing about drag and drop. The textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version 15.50 dated 5/22/90 while doing a 'what textedit' on the OWN 3.0 binary says: textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro tooltalk.c 2.16 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro ds_relname.c    1.7 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro So does anyone know if the 9/14/91 sources to textedit are available? I'd really like to work from the latest source if possible. Please reply by email and I'll post a summary if there's enough interest. -- Matt Landau			Waiting for a flash of enlightenment matt@centerline.com			  in all this blood and thunder
1,I have noticed in FrameMaker 3.1X on both the SGI and SUN platforms that certain dialogs such as Column Layout... for example respond to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is NOT in the dialog window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is POINTER. How is this done? I would like to emulate this behavior in my application. It seems a reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard action the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus. Alternatively I'm open to any suggestions as to what is the right way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear particularly when they are invoked from the keyboard and one's keyboard focus policy is pointer.

1,I'm writing an application running under X (using Motif) and I need to do some stuff when the application quits.  Now when I shut down my X Windows session it doesn't seem to send a SIGTERM (or whatever) signal to my application (I'm trapping various signals like that).  Therefore I thought I could use an X signal to check for my top level window being destroyed. However I seem to get DestroyNotify events whenever I move windows.  Is there any way for me to check that the window is actually being destroyed (some field to check or some combination of events?). Replies by e-mail please and I will summarise.

1,Dear Folks: It's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program Xavier an audio and video  extension to InterViews. Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects. Specifically it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1 and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file). Currently the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface such as the SPARCstation2.

1,I'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding standard colormaps. The X11R5 documentation says: Usually a window manager creates these colormaps.  I wonder what window manager the writer had in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps. Of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps. However xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes black. So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps if every application used standard colormaps things would be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use standard colormaps. Finally the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation XmuStandardColormap and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation. According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436): For GrayScale colormaps only the colormap red_max red_mult and base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored. To compute a GrayScale pixel value use the following expression: (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF XmuGetColormapAllocation defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c is used by XmuLookupStandardColormap defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c to select red_max green_max and blue_max values for the call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the total number of cells in the gray scale sets green_max to 59% of the total number and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number. Referring to section 14.3 one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale. When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified XmuStandardColormap defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c sets red_mult green_mult and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3 one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored. When red_mult green_mult and blue_mult all equal 1 XmuCreateColormap defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c constructs a gray map. The sum of red_max green_max and blue_max gives the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3 on would expect red_max to give the maximum gray value.

1,Hi All! I tried to run SoftPC a PC emulation software program installed on a Silicon Graphics workstation from a Human Design System (HDS) X terminal and everything went fine except the fonts could NOT be converted from one type of format to the other - HDS uses different font format from SGI worksation. So I have the following questions: 1. How do you resolve different font formats from different machines? 2. Is there a program to convert one type of font format to another? If you have similar problems/experiences and have found a solution please let me know.  Your help will be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance for your help and information.

Standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managers would make them available. This doesn't mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and implemented this at top priority. The ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at startup. It doesn't wait for window managers to do it. > Of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps. > However xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid > conflicts with the default colormap.

Perhaps > if every application used standard colormaps things would > be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use > standard colormaps. Does your hardware have only one CLUT? Since standard colormaps typically devour all 256 entries there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one CLUT. I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's called under X11R5). If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap. If you can't do that then you'll get flashing on a one hw CLUT framebuffer. Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps? -- -paul	pmartz@dsd.es.com Evans & Sutherland

1,I am *almost* done porting XFree86 1.2 to a new piece of display hardware but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat commonplace so I'm sending a net-feeler. I have a display that is a non-interlaced memory mapped 1-bit 720x280 display.  The server's view of the world (obtained via xwd | xwud) seems to be exactly what it should be.  However the displayed version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is using scanlines that are too long.  After a bit of experimentation it seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to a word boundry but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes which isn't exactly divisible by four.  Changing the following defines in mit/server/include/servermd.h: ---- #define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  32 #define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		5 #define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2 --- to: --- #define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  16 #define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		4 #define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2 --- Was not exactly the right solution.  How do I tell the server either (a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being built to run on this particular display) or to pad only to byte boundries? I'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2 under Mach 3.0. Thanks Brian
1,These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these specific questions. 1.  If my application depends on modifiers what is the best lookup method? My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a modifier or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way but I can't seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that when an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated (non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But I don't seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt all O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib ala XNextEvent() I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier requirements. 2.  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window.  I want it at the same y coord and their right/left sides touching.  What I need to ask for is the xy coord of the window manager's border for the main window.  This should ring a bell with anyone who has called XtMoveWidget() immediately checking the xy after the move and seeing that it is right and in their next callback asking for the xy and seeing that it is now offset by the WM border. Any help would be most appreciated. Darcy darcy_mccallum@mentorg.com
1,I have the following problem on X11R5 servers. When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has the Save Under attribute set the subwindows of my window are not restored. Normally the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose event but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window that obscured my window no expose event is sent. When ExposureMask is set for the child windows those windows are correctly updated when the popup window disappears however then the application gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws. Everything works fine with X11R4. Is this something that is changed between X11R4 and X11R5 (obvious)? Is it something I do wrong? Is there something that the popup window should do (which is also mine)? Is this a bug in X11 release 5?

1,I posted this about tow weeks ago but never saw it make it (Then again I've had some problems with the mail system). Apologies if this appears for the second time: Usually when I start up an application I first get the window outline on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry option the window appears right away the properties specified by the -geometry argument. The question now is: How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window size and position but that did alter the normal program behaviour. Thanks for any hints ---> Robert PS: I'm working in plain X using tvtwm. ****************************************************************************** * Robert Gasch        * Der erste Mai ist der Tag an dem die Stadt ins      * * Oracle Engineering   * Freihe tritt und den staatlichen Monopolanspruch    * * De Meern NL        * auf Gewalt in Frage stellt                          * * rgasch@nl.oracle.com *                           - Einstuerzende Neubauten * ****************************************************************************** ----------------------- Headers ------------------------ >From uupsi7!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xpert-mailer Thu Apr 22 17:24:28 1993 remote from aolsys Received: from uupsi7 by aolsys.aol.com id aa19841; Thu 22 Apr 93 17:10:35 EDT Received: from srmftp.psi.com by uu7.psi.com (5.65b/4.0.071791-PSI/PSINet) via SMTP; id AA02784 for ; Thu 22 Apr 93 12:04:36 -0400 Received: from expo.lcs.mit.edu by srmftp.psi.com (4.1/3.1.072291-PSI/PSINet) id AA17104; Thu 22 Apr 93 10:19:31 EDT Received: by expo.lcs.mit.edu; Thu 22 Apr 93 06:57:38 -0400 Received: from ENTERPOOP.MIT.EDU by expo.lcs.mit.edu; Thu 22 Apr 93 06:57:37 -0400 Received: by enterpoop.MIT.EDU (5.57/4.7) id AA27271; Thu 22 Apr 93 06:57:14 -0400 Received: from USENET by enterpoop with netnewsfor xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu (xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu);contact usenet@enterpoop if you have questions.

1,Dear sun and windows people I am running sun workstations with SunOs 4.1.1 and vanilla X11 R5. I have a bunch of xterminals as well. Today I had my xdm fail. At about 9:30 it was impossible to login to a host from an xterminal. The message was the xdm too many retransmissions. In my xdm-errors file I had the following entries: >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly: >256 >error (pid 7927): WARNING: keyboard on display :0 could not be >secured >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly: > >I also had: > >error (pid 7457): WARNING: keyboard on display :0 could not be >secured >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly: >256 >error (pid 7462): WARNING: keyboard on display :0 could not be >secured >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly: >256 Also at the console the login box would come up for about 2 seconds and then it would go away. It would do this continuously. I could login from another workstation to the hosts in question however I could not login on the console. I tried killing xdm and restarting it but that didn't help. I finally rebooted all the hosts. (Which hurts when done in the middle of the day). Any help would be appreciated.

1,X Window installation on a Sun4/470 with CG6 alone and with CG2 as screen:0.0 and CG6 as screen:0.1. Questions: 1)  Are there any hardware configuration changes on the CG2 and/or CG6 devices that need to be made other than pulling out and inserting the CG2 frame buffer in the vme bus? 2)  The CG6 is called a 'graphics accelerator' as apposed to a 'frame buffer'. What is the significance of this to the X server and how do we install the SunOS driver / X to be compatable. ----------------------- I would appreciate any information on this. I am posting this on the behalf of Dr. John Charlton (who does not have net access). Please reply to him directly at charlton@bme.unc.edu or just send it at this address and I will forward it.

1,We have a Sun 3/80 and we have just acquired a cg8 frame buffer card. The cg8 is supposed to support both a 24-bit color visual and a monochrome visual. The default visual for the xnews server is the monochrome and we are unable to change it to the 24-bit visual. We have tried using XGetVisualInfo to get a visual of depth 24 but had no success.  xdpyinfo gives no information about a 24-bit deep visual only monochrome. There are two possible solutions: If someone has patches for X11R5 Xsun server could they forward them to us? Otherwise could someone instruct us how to access the 24-bit color in openwindows? -- Jon Herlocker		email:  herlock@lclark.edu Lewis & Clark College Portland OR 97219
1,Hi netters! I've just built X11R5 pl 21 under Solaris 2.1. I've used the multi-screen patch as well as the R5.SunOS... patch and everything builds great except for that error message Xsun gives me upon startup. It says: Cannot set default font path '[stuff deleted]' and Cannot set default font 'fixed'. If I supply the -fp option it doesn't complain about the font path but still complains about the font. I have symlinks from /usr/lib/ to the place where my distribution lives.

1,We've just recently upgraded our X11 to R5 and are now running into problems with some of our applications that use Motif 1.1.  It appears that pointer to the widget being passed to the callback function (i.e. the w of (w client call) ) is nil.  The client and call pointers are okay in some instances but bogus in other instances. We are running SunOS 4.1.2 on a Sun 4.  After compiling X11R5 and all 23 patches (with the MotifBC flag set) we recompiled Motif and then we recompiled the application. Did we skip a step or leave something out?  Is there a flag that we should have used?  Should we have left Motif alone? Any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Hmmm.  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all?  Are you running any standard MS-Windows programs like Word ?  What sort of packets go blazing through?

What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you have few high peaks and then many low points? >It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going >to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all >doing network things also...) >-- What do you mean by network things?

1,Hi there (I posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response so I'm posting here.) I'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation (an HP 720). It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices including digitiser tablets.  However this digitiser makes use of the serial port so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver. The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from devices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number). I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input device in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I? What I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected to their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a specific X application)?  If so what were the steps required for installation? Did you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Are there generic public domain device drivers around?  (I understand that digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.) Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1,I've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. I decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system). I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring the standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core  and upon analysis it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor was called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that says you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic. We are running on SGI Irix 4.0.1 with X11R4. -- Regards Martin /\/\     :  Martin Visser - Electrical / Software Engineer / / /\    :  Engineering Technology Department / / /  \   :  BHP Steel - Slab and Plate Products Division / / / /\ \  :  P.O.

Judging from the responses so far I have not made clear enough in my article quoted above that Imake-TeX is not for installing TeX but for *using* it. With Imake-TeX you will never again have to fiddle around with calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex bibtex). Simply type make and your document's DVI file will be up-to-date. All you have to do is to write a simple Imakefile and let Imake generate a suitable Makefile for you.

1,Hi ppl I am running XFree386 under Linux SLS1.0 and am trying to get the german keyboard working. I have already recompiled my kernel and the german keyboard in the textmode works just fine. I have found out that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X called Xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/X11 so I ran xmodmap /usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap.gr. My first impression was very good I was able to get Z and Y straight :) There's still a little problem I can't solve however: I cannot get at the backslash bar brackets and curly brackets. The ALT-GR key doesn't seem to work. I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does. Looking up its keycode (113) in the Xmodmap I found the entry Mode_switch which doesn't ring any bell. The entries for the keys I cannot use seem to be correct. Example: keycode XX = ssharp questn backslash The first 2 entries I can even get at. The first one is the unmodified key and the second is the key with shift but what is the 3rd?? My guess is that it should be the key with ALT-GR but it isn't. If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them help would be appreciated. CU Alaric

1,I have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes and collects data from that nodes periodically. I need to display this data on my X Application. I tried to invoke this server using XtAddAppTimeout which works ok. But the problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data. So I doesn't returns to EventLoop during that time and my application remains busy and It doesn't respond to users input. I button press events are queued and exected after server finished its task. Now I am going to try AppAddInput call. So that It reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe. I am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client which is my X application will read. Now I have some doubts which you may be able to clarify. 1) When I fork a process. It will create to copy of my process. Right !! Now what does this two copies mean? Two Shells. Where should I fork my application. What are the responsibilities of this processes. How should I call this processes.? 2) Can I fork more than one processes. So that I can read from more than one servers input.

1,Hi I am trying to write an X-windows based interface that runs on top of GDB. Could anyone help me in understanding the way we are supposed to fork GDB off as a subprocess ?? I currently use pipes but when I try and debug this program the following happens : PROGRAM : main() { int x; printf(enter x : ); scanf(%d &x); printf(x = .%d.\n x ); } OUTPUT : The program hangs without returning the output of the printf statement. When I type in a value (like 5) then all the printf's output comes out at one time. Is there any other way besides using PIPES to do this i.e. like ioctl or something else ??

1,Hello X'ers I have a problem: I am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes. The following code illustrates the problem: #include <stdio.h> #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <X11/Xutil.h> main() { Display *display; Window win; XVisualInfo vinfo; Colormap colormap; XSetWindowAttributes attributes; XEvent event; Status status; display=XOpenDisplay(NULL); status=XMatchVisualInfo(displayDefaultScreen(display)24TrueColor &vinfo); if (!status){ fprintf(stderrVisual not found\n); exit(1); } colormap=XCreateColormap(displayDefaultRootWindow(display) vinfo.visualAllocNone); attributes.colormap=colormap; win=XCreateWindow(displayDefaultRootWindow(display)00100100 024InputOutputvinfo.visualCWColormap&attributes); XMapWindow(displaywin); for (;;){ XNextEvent(display&event); } } I tried this with an SGI with 24 plane TrueColor server and with an HP 9000-700 24 plane DirectColor server (with the obviously neccessary change) both running X11R4. On the client side I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on HP 9000-700 and DECstation and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All the combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request. As far as I can tell from the manual the only attribute which may give a BadMatch is the colormap if it belongs to a wrong visual. But the visual was correctly matched as I did not get the error message. What am I doing wrong? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the same error.

The first sentence describing the bitmap resource in the MenuButton section of the Athena Widget Set - C Language Interface documentation states bitmap      A bitmap to display instead of the label. One way round this might be to make use of the button's backgroundPixmap resource but remember that you or a user of your application won't be able to set it from a resource file. Also the button won't automatically be the size of the bitmap. The bitmap will be tiled if necessary or you could set the button's dimensions to match its size.

When the Transient shell is popped-down the button sensitivity is correct but the button text remains unchanged (i.e. solid/shaded).  Subsequent selection of the button causes the text to revert to the correct visual state.

Had you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the IJG JPEG code (which are right there in the xv distribution) you would have observed that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware and commercial software.

1,I'm trying to turn on Xauthorization using MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE on my servers (CPU heads HP700RX Xterminals) but I'm running into a couple of problems. First at least one of our applications (Maple) doesn't seem to understand how to deliver the magic cookie and won't run on a display with authorization turned on. Second we have people with client software on remote machines and I really don't want to hassle them with having to copy their .Xauthority file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support Xauthorization. So what I would like to do is turn on MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE by default with non-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based authorization. (Yes I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the heads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals but non-privileged users can't do this.) I've checked with the HP Support Line and there doesn't appear to be a way. Can anyone confirm this or do you know of a way to accomplish what I want? BTW I'm running HPUX 9.0 and Vue 3.0.

1,I am having the problem of ensuring point-to-focus when the mouse cursor enters a window in my application.  I'm using InterViews but that may not matter this seems to be a generic problem in X. For example I use OpenWindows on a Sparc2 with point-to-focus set and that generally works but not always depending on what was going on in some window when I move the cursor from one shell tool window to another.  Or so it seems... My question then is what can I do within X to guarantee point-to- focus within my application?  Thanks for any response. Dave

1,I am looking for a  program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my Linux system. - It must be free. - It must run on standard (monochrome) X with a small screen size (800x600) No motif/openlook etc. - It must compile under Linux with gcc/g++. Most generic unix software works ok. - It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents with dvips. Or just tell me another free program that converts one of the supported formats to ps. - It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable). I know of several such programs idraw xfig. tgif. I have no experience with any of them. Features I would like in the programs are. - ability to draw circles arcs straight lines boxes and arrows. - support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects. - support for texts in any size. - ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing. - ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines an arrow and a circle) - any aid (numeric coordinates screen grid) to align parts of the drawing. - less essential but in fact very handy: preservation of connection. If I move one part of the drawing the lines that connect that part to the rest of the drawing stay connected. Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to draw electronic schematics flow charts logic diagrams data flow diagrams and block diagrams with it. I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my whishlist and are there any other programs? How demanding are the programs with respect to disk space memory and CPU usage? Are any of the programs known to work on Linux with monochrome X? Lennart.
1,The Andrew Consortium of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon is pleased to announce AUIS 5.1.1 for AIX3.2 4/26/93 The Andrew User Interface System version 5.1 (our CDrom version) was developed for AIX  version 3.1 on the IBM RS/6000 and many other platforms.  To accomodate AIX version 3.2 we have created a patch to the sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory ./aixpatch.  For those without internet access a 3.5 diskette can be ordered for $10 by sending or faxing a purchase order to the address below. The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the same host. Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows AUIS to compile under AIX3.2. ----------- The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment on top of X11 windows in which you can create use and mail multi-media applications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the capability to recursively embed objects.  Thus one can edit text that not only contains multiple fonts indentation and other typography but also  contains embedded raster images spreadsheets drawing editors equations simple animations and so on. These embedded objects can themselves contain other objects including text. AUIS has three components: The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set of applications beginning with the ez text editor a help system a system monitoring tool an editor-based shell interface and other editors corresponding to the various available types of objects. The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable object-oriented user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as easily as those that come with the system. The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail management strategies and implements many advanced  features including authentication return receipts automatic sorting of mail vote collection and tabulation enclosures audit trails of related messages and subscription management. It also provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and low-function personal computers in addition to high-function workstations. The current public release of Andrew Version 5.1  includes support for the new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards for multipart multimedia mail.  A newer release 5.2 for members of the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new editors for drawings images fonts and user preferences. Remote Andrew Demo Service You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew Demo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11 window system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour and use the Andrew Message System to browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and newsgroups. To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service simply run the following command on your machine: finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu The service will give you further instructions.

1,REPOST: I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure events are handled. I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a fake Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data. Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way? Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

1,Hi I have an application which draws graphs bar charts etc. I need to include print support for these from within my application i.e. a user can print the graphs from within the applictaion by clicking on a print button. I am not sure if I can invoke xwd & xpr from within my application and specify the window id to get my window dump and then send this file for printing or if there are other ways of doing this. I would appreciate any help in this regard. Thanx. - Mahendra. PS : Please mail your replies to me as I am not a regular reader of this news group.

1,One way to mask the left button check the contents of the XEvent that the XAddEventHandler send to your event_handling function (in your case it is the show_mouse_position function. If the XEvent arrive in this function as XEvent p_event; then the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. So you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. In case it was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. By the way you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with these MotionMasks I would be grateful. I can not figure out how do distinguish between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. In essence I would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button. Unfortunately the XEvent sent by a MotionMask does not seem to contain the value of the pressed button. Any ideas eps
1,Can anybody tell me anything about the availibility of non-Roman fonts for X-Windows? Especially Unicode and/or han idiographic fonts. Also how about conversion tools for getting PC/Macintosh fonts into a format suitable for X? I would assume it is not too difficult for bitmap fonts.

1,Hello!!! The title just about says it all. I need a list of the bugs for Motif 1.2. Thanks Neal
1,I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif but I'm hoping is really just a mistake on my part.  Does anyone know anything about this problem........ - I am using an XmTextField and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString. The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed the text is getting truncated depending on the setting of the environment variables LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english everything works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns. (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual application just in my sample code to make things easier) - I am running Motif 1.2 X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources are set to japanese fonts. - Don't know if this matters but my dialog box and TextField is initially created with UIL. The problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!) I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese but since I don't have the source to look at it is just a guess. Please let me know if this sounds familiar or if you have a suggestion or if you want the sample program. THANKS!!!!!!!! - Susan swalker@bbn.com 617-873-8190

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents windows a misfeature of the X protocol and a bug in the Xt intrinsics. The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (xy) position given in ReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that when a window is popped down the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. At this point the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date. If a SetValues is done using the same (xy) position the Intrinsics thinks it needs to move the shell so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it there.  However a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive and times out after wmTimeout has expired.  (Actually things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager but the net result is the same.) The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (xy) positioning information in ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5 public fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in gorier details. s'marks -- Stuart W. Marks				stuart.marks@eng.sun.com Window Systems Technology		2550 Garcia Ave. M/S 21-228 SunSoft Inc.

1,I don't seem to be able to get window positions reliably through the XView xv_get() function: x = (int) xv_get(my_frame XV_X); y = (int) xv_get(my_frame XV_Y); For example if I set XV_X & XV_Y to 5050 the frame comes up in the correct position with the top left corner (the size handle) at 5050. xv_get() returns 5050 as well. But later on xv_get() returns 525 without any intervening xv_set(my_frame XV_?). My frame is fitted around a canvas and it turns out (by measuring on the screen) that 525 is the position of the first pixel in my canvas relative to the frame's origin. What gives? Any help most appreciated! Derek P.S. On a related subject is there any way of querying the window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around frames etc.? ----------------------------------------------------------- | Derek C.

1,Answers please by e-mail since not all groups in the header are carried here. Hi! Personally I like NeXTSTEP very much. Even more when I realise how much a burden ordinary X or Windows programming is. I also like Objective-C better than I like C++. But sometimes the restrictions are there. For instance it sometimes has to be MS-Windows or X. Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments that come close to NeXTSTEP the appkit etc. Also environs that support rapid prototyping (like with IB) without producing spaghetti-code as soon as you want to do real work. Maybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects? Interviews (what it is exactly I don't know. I kind of lost touch with that world when I started with NeXTSTEP.)

I want to install an X11R5 or X11R4 server on my Sun and use xdm (yes we have xdm already running for other X-Terminals) to log in and start the X programs. Is there a ready to go binairy of the X11 server for my configuration (I have read something about Xsun) or must I compile the X11 stuff by myself? Any help is welcome V.

1,Hello I am admin for an RS/6000 running AIX 3.2 X11R5 Motif and xdt3. I want to prevent the user from hitting CNTL-ALT-BKSPC to exit X. I've tried invoking X with 'xinit -T' but that doesn't work. xinit appends the -T to the call to .xinitrc and not to the call to X. The man page to xinit is no help.  In fact it tells me that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file. So far the only way I've been able to accomplish this feat is to add the -T to the call to X in /usr/lpp/X11/defaults/xserverrc. I would rather not do it this way.  Does anyone have any other ideas? ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Brian DeFord				Internet: deford@netwrx1.nw1.com Open Networks Inc.

1,> It is interesting to look at the change(s) of mind that John has had. Very interested indeed! This is against this kind of changes that the GNU COPYLEFT is protecting us. Anyway at SIMULOG we will abandon xv. We were using it mostly for slide- shows because of its -loop feature that display does not have (display from the *wonderful* ImageMagick package! :-D) but I think I will implement it myself (even a shell-script should do the job) and forget xv.

1,I am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on another machine (both are HP 9000 Model 750s).  The image is created using XCreateImage and XGetImage and displayed with XPutImage.  The image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because the server on the other machine is using a different colormap. I tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay performed a table lookup against the new colormap.  This didn't work because some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap. Is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values or is there a simpler way to solve this problem?  I tried using xinitcolormap but couldn't get that to work either. Any help would be appreciated. -------------------------------------- Don Lemoine Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division Dahlgren VA 22405 (703)663-7917 dlemoin@xobu.nswc.navy.mil
1,Has anyone used DCE threads with an X Client? Is it possible to have one thread listening for incoming RPCs while another processes X Events? How do you set something like this up? _ Atul (apara@ctp.com)
1,[[ I posted this a few weeks back but all I got back was an error message pnews: /dev/null: Permission denied.  Yep /dev/null had a mode of 600.  (Arrghhh!!)  ]] With renewed interest in setting the DISPLAY variable etc.. I thought I would post my contribution. This Perl script is my solution.  It trys to be intelligent about what it's doing so that you should be able to type rx host.domain.etc and get a xterm running on host.domain.etc with all the difficult stuff taken care of. In theory this program can do *everything* you ever wanted to do when you wanted to run a remote command in the background - it doesn't even need to be an X program.  Try a rx big-machine make for instance for a backgrounded make on the remote big-machine. For more details and a full list of features read the README file about 20 lines below...

Version 3.1.7 X XCopyright 1992 Duncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk> X XTrivial to install but there's an Imakefile to make it even more trivial. X XThe perl script needs some customisation before it is installed just Xedit the rx.pl file and read the comments.  Once you've done Xthis you can xmkmf then make install install.man. X XFEATURES: X X*) Does the right thing for off-site remote execution.  Including X   setting up $DISPLAY to include domain names and passing X   magic cookies or doing the xhost stuff. X X*) Allow different remote user name.  (rx -l user host ...) X X*) Smart quoting of arguments - makes passing wild-cards easy. X X*) Custom command execution - link it to remacs to get a remote X   emacs command. X X*) Automatic xterm options - names the xterm according to hostname X   and turns on login shell. X X*) Default command is xterm. X X*) Propagates X-ish env. variables to remote session - user may X   extend the list of variables to pass. X X*) Special handling for bourne shell users. X X*) Tries to do remote execution from same directory as local. X   That is it propagates $PWD in an intelligent manner. X X*) Logs errors in a file.

1,We are planning on buying 15-20 X Terminals.  I have the article from Jim Morton regarding prices etc. and am looking for any other information that will help me decide which to buy. The terminals will be connected to a DEC 3000/400 AXP with 96Mb RAM running OSF/1.  From what I have found out so far it would be best to run as much as possible in the terminal itself (X11 window manager xterm etc.) and that in order to do this we need n Mb RAM in the Xterminal (where n ranges from 4 to 10 depending on who I talk to). What should I be looking for?  What sort of questions should I be asking the salespeople? Thanks Trevor J. Smedley - smedley@tuns.ca School of Computer Science Technical University of Nova Scotia

1,Posted for a friend without posting access (but with e-mail access...) ---------------------------- Help anyone! I have a X client that is abnormally terminated with the following message: XIO:   fatal IO error 22 (Invalid argument) on X server xxxxx:0.0 after 10058 requests (10057 known processed) with 78 events remaining. It has been known to occur when displaying on the Xsun (X11R4) server.  It occurs with a higher frequency when the client displays on the Xdomain (X11R4) server running on DomainOS 10.3.5 on an Apollo. Anybody know why this may be happening? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Reply-To: has been set to me.  I'll summarize to the net.

I don't know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th Keypress event.  Of course if there is some reason why you need to always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the keyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root window.  Then you get all the KeyPresses and you always know what have been pressed. >An even more pointed question: Is there an easy means of making an X >keyboard act like a PC keyboard?  ie CapsLock is active and the user >presses shift-a I'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'A'. I think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString. You can always write another function that interprets the KeyPresses as you like.  You can look at the implementation of XLookupString from the Xlib sources and then modify it a little bit. -- Sami.Tikka@hut.fi | /G=Sami/S=Tikka/O=hut/ADMD=fumail/C=fi/ Live Long and Prosper!
1,** I am posting this for a friend ** ** please respond to vaughn%sonatech@hub.ucsb.edu ** I'm working on an application where we are creating a dither pattern and rendering it in a window by applying it to the stipple pattern of the GC.  The following code segment almost works if the window width is an even multiple of 8.  If it is not an even multiple it skews the pattern towards the right.  Another problem whether it is an even multiple of 8 or not is a series of vertical lines spaced 8 pixels apart. extern	Display	       *dpy; extern	Window		xid; extern	GC		gc; extern	int	Max_X Max_Y;		/* set in resize handler	*/ dither(pixels) char	*pixels;		/* dither pattern data		*/ { char	*bm;			/* bitmap data			*/ char    *bmp; long	 I arraymax; arraymax = Max_X*Max_Y; bm  = (char *)malloc(arraymax); bmp = bm; for (I=j=0; I<arraymax; I++) { if (pixels[I] & DITHER_BIT) *bmp |=   2<<j;		/* pixel on		*/ else *bmp &= ~(2<<j);	/* pixel off		*/ if (++j > 7) { bmp++; j = 0; } } stipple = XCreateBitmapFromData(dpy xid bm Max_X Max_Y); free(bm); XClearWindow(dpy xid); XSetStipple(dpy gc stipple); XSetFillStyle(dpy gc FillStippled); XFillRectangle(dpy xid gc 0 0 Max_X Max_Y); XSetFillStyle(dpy gc FillSolid); } I suspect the answer is to pad the data. -- Mike Vaughn Sonatech
1,> If I use Xt all > O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib ala XNextEvent() I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of > the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier > requirements. That's not all it says.  The coverage of modifiers is in Chapter 8 of Volume Four (or chap 7 in older Athena editions) where there is about 10 pages on how to specify translations to capture various combinations of keys or buttons. The Xlib route uses XLookupString and there is a lot of coverage of how that works in Volume One  chapter 9.  You should read this to understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything complicated. Adrian Nye O'Reilly and Associates

1,We are making a transition from NextStep to X-windows. I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs.  I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X X-designer Tele-Use tcl/tkInterviews and SUIT. So far I've drawn the following conclusions: 1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature bad docs 2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit 3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one) 4) tcl/tk is a little buggy 5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info) 6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product. 7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money) 8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work 9) this type of tool seems great but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ? 10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development. I'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products. thanks --- *	Bruce Trvalik  AOA-----------------* *       (617)864-0201   check your mind at the door - The Band That Time Forgot *	moose@aoa.utc.com *       aoa!moose@bbn.com

1,Just create the window in the place you want it and set the program position field in the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property then map it. Then assuming they have a non brain dead window manager the user can say whether they want to us program specified positions or not. For tvtwm the UsePPosition command in the .tvtwmrc will do this. Now I'm sure that by the time this message gets out of our local news timewarp someone will have advised you to set the user position bit in the WM_NORMAL_HINTS. _Do_not_ do this. It's evil. It's a disservice to your users. Offler the tusked crocodile god will come in the night and remove your vital organs with a blunt spoon if you even contemplate it. -- rjc@cogsci.ed.ac.uk			_O_ |<
1,Hi I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running SunOS 4.1.1.  Prior to using xdm I used to set PATH and other environment variables (like MANPATH HELPPATH ARCH etc) in my .login file.  With xdm the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm root-window nor my applications know about these variables. I used the DisplayManager._0.userPath resource in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config to succesfully pass the PATH variable.  But I am having problems passing anything else!!!  I tried execing $HOME/.login in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession but that didn't help.  I also tried using DisplayManager.exportList: HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH which didn't work either. I would appreciate any help on this matter.

1,Hello Our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows in a number of applications.  We are trying to use action translation tables to implement this.  We have only succeeded by assigning the translation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single application.  The Xt calls we make are included below. It would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation table to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations and also accomplish it for MULTIPLE applications.  If someone could describe how do this it would be greatly appreciated.

Since I don't think Tom always gets time to read this group I'll take the liberty of responding to some of this.  If you really want Tom to reply you should send mail to support@qdeck.com. A 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps ethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on what you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instances of some really nasty program like Smoking Clover would make the link useless for anyone else.  On the other hand probably 50 xclocks quietly updating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real world you will be somewhere in between these two extremes. Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis I wouldn't want to have to share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people. >>Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding >>in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of >>thing) you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before >>you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). > >Hmmm.

Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other.  The usage patterns are not very good predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they often use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database remotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always at this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having a long hop to the server.  As I warned you this tells us very little about how you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link. Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent. Let's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy and efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a little more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server that it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network traffic. If no backing store then what was being covered up?  If it was a solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite easily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send it back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw that small area but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be repainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits that has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds. In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls. > > >>It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going >>to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all >>doing network things also...) >>-- > >What do you mean by network things?

X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's pretty good for this.  X programs are best DOS text programs are almost as good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid. We intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can but we are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications tell us. +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |   Quarterdeck Office Systems                    ____________________/_   | |         Gary Rich - Problem Resolution Dept.    _________________///__\  | |  _____________________________________________  ______________/////___\  | |   Anonymous FTP site = qdeck.com                ___________///////____\  | |          ---For---          ---Write to---      ________/////////_____\  | |    Pricing/Ordering info :  info@qdeck.com      _____///////////______\  | |     Technical Questions  : support@qdeck.com    __/////////////_______\  | |         Quarterdeck BBS - (310) 314-3227        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  | +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In the list you mentioned tgif handles everything except rotation and any size text.  It only supports 90 degrees rotation.  Currently it supports 11 (X11R4 standard) font sizes.  However it allows arbitrary scaling of the entire drawing.  Effectively it allows any font sizes but you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing. Tgif takes up 850K (compiled with -O option) on a SPARCstation.  I was told that it compiles under Linux but I haven't tried it yet.  It works with both color and monochrome X. -- Bill Cheng // UCLA Computer Science Department // (310) 645-8328 3564-C Boelter Hall // Los Angeles California 90024 // USA william@CS.UCLA.EDU      ...!{uunet|ucbvax}!cs.ucla.edu!william
1,Greetings We have a network of ~20 Sun Workstations running SunOS 4.1.1 and Openwindows 3.  7 of these are Sun 3's that we have modified to run Seth Robertson's xkernel image effectively turning them into xterminals.  We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays. When we had 3 xkernel machines things worked fine but when we installed 4 more last weekend we appear to have found a weakness. With 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2 the Sparc 2 window manager is eventually getting munged. Let me try to be precise:  The user sitting at the machine that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having control of his keyboard and screen yanked away.  (When this was the department chair it was kind of cute).  We poked at xdm for a few days and are satisfied that it is not at fault.  Our current theory is that olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal server). Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior? Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory? How about obvious gimmes? And of course any ideas on how to solve it? Any ideas are greatly appreciated. Greg Owen  { gowen@forte.cs.tufts.edu gowen@jade.tufts.edu } Systems Programmer and TA Tufts University Computer Science Dept.

As soon as I added codes to do Remote Procedure Call the program refused to work.  I also have my program working using just Xlib calls with RPC.

1,We're looking at various X11 clients for PC's and we're looking for some information about the relative efficiency of different products.  Are any notably efficient (fast)?  Are any notably inefficient?  I assume that a Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now I'm looking at ico running on Xoftware/32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCP/IP platform and it's (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the Sparc10's console.  What are the key ways of improving performance for PC (presumably Windows) clients? Also what about async solutions?  (Yes I appreciate that it will be *much* slower even with V.42bis.)  I'm in the process of installing PPP (with header compression).  How does that compare to cslip?  I've seen a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient but are there comparable products out there?  If we're looking for efficiency for async PC clients what should we be looking at in addition to standard PPP w/ compression and XRemote? Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I'm still taking in all the information in the faq but any tips about the relative efficiency of various product offerings would be great.  (I get the impression that discussions about speed are largely application specific but that not withstanding any comments would be appreciated.)  Thanks. -- Rob -- Rob Ryan System Constructs Inc. rryan@panix.com
1,Most graphics systems I have seen have drawing routines that also specify a color for drawing like Drawpoint(xycolor) or Drawline(x1y1x2y2color) or Fillrectangle(x1y1x2y2color) With X I have to do something like XSetForeground(current_color) XDrawPoint(dwxy) Why split this into two functions? Why did X designers decide to not associate the color with the object being drawn and instead associate it with the display it is being drawn on? Joseph Sirosh

One usual suggestion is to put everything into your every-time shell rc-file instead of your login-only one which is fair enough if you only have a few users who know what they're doing.  If you have several hundred users who do what the books tell them though then it's confusing at best.  Another is to have your xterms run login shells but that still leaves the window manager and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment. Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts it runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell and has *it* then run the rest of the startup scripts.  That way the user's usual environment gets set up as normal and inherited by everything.

1,Greetings. I am developing an application that allows a *user* to interactively create/edit/view a visual model (i.e. topology) of their network and I was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to simplify this task. In the past I have used Visual Edge's UIM/X product to develop other GUIs so I am familiar with UIMSs in general. The topology will support objects and connecting links.  Once the topology is created I want to provide the user with capabilities to support grouping zooming etc. I am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing routines to accomplish this.  Specifically the zooming and grouping aspects may prove difficult and certainly time consuming  if I have to roll my own. Suggestions? -greg greg@software.mitel.com

In X10 the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing requests;  that is the server's drawing model was stateless. This caused problems with performance and network traffic so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify the drawing state.  Most application designers who want to draw things in several different colors create a GC for each color during initialization then pass the GC id in each drawing request. For more information see Scheifler and Gettys's article in the 1986 ACM Transactions on Graphics.

1,Hi all I wrote a small application which uses pixmaps copied into a window to show some drawings. This works perfectly for all kind of objects expect large fonts. What happens on the screen is that the right half of the font is not shown. The way I create these things is quite simple; some aggregated code: XFillRectangle(Disp Pixs AnyColor 0 0 Width Height); XDraw[Line|Rect|String](...); XCopyArea(Disp Pixs Win 0 0 Width Height 0 0); I am using a RS6K 340 with BOS 3.2. The question is: is this a bug in the AIX X-server (may be some PTFs) or did I do something wrong within my code?? Sorry for the cross-posting but I really do not know what kind of error it is.

Anyway what you say is not really true. The color information is associated with a GraphicsContext not with a display and the GC _IS_ a parameter to the drawing routines. So if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of width 2 you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do XDrawLine(dpywingc_redx1y1x2y2); XDrawLine(dpywingc_bluex3y3x4y4); for this effect. This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer but also much more efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters like line pattern with cap and joinstyle drawmode and so on in every drawing call so why do it for color ? BTW stay away from XDrawPoint() if you don't really need it (to draw RANDOM points) for image transfers there are Image routines. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+

1,I have the task to program a X application for the first time and have some severe difficulties creating a window in which I can draw something. Unfortunately some basic books on the topic of X application programming are not available to me for the moment. I am running a hp720 with hpux 8.07 VUE and X11R4 using Xt anbd Xaw. What I did until now: I initialized the X Intrinsics cxreating a top level widget with XtAppInitialize. I passed as a application_class name 'commandWidgetClass'. Then I set the argument values for window height and width using XtSetArg and passed it to the toplevel widget with XtSetValues. When I call XtRealizeWidget I get a window of the specified size but I have no idea how I can draw something in it. Can anybody send me some help and perhaps some basic information how to use the widgets ? In which situation it is useful to use them and in which not ?

1,The Only directory I know of that lists commercial and non-commercial widgets is the ICS Widget Data book.  ICS sells the widgets for various prices.  There are also some public domain widgets in the delivery. The ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing where you pay some nominal fee get a cd with the widgets and then you can use the public domain widgets freely and selectively activate widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. The nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets such as those used in dataviews.  I dont know there pricing schemes but It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex widgets especially if you only one customer to distribute to. This is the extent that I know about them except that I got their databook catalog  and it looked impressive (lots o' widgets there) I dont work for ICS or have any widgets being sold by them. hope this helps you. -- Brian Dealy                |301-572-8267| It not knowing where it's at dealy@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov   |            | that's importantit's knowing !uunet!dftsrv!kong!dealy   |            | where it's not at...

1,I have a SPARC-2 with 2 CGSIX cards in it.  I'd like to have the R5 server recognize the second card. I mknod created a /dev/cgsix1 device but when I brought up the server the second device was ignored. How do I setup the second card? Note:  If I borrow a cgthree card and put a cgthree and a cgsix card in the same SPARC-2 box the R5 server finds the second card. I then set the DISPLAY to the second card and start a second window manager. Worse case is I trade cards with someone but maybe someone out there has seen this problem already... email is preferred... post if you must... Thanks in advance....

1,Rather than write my own can anyone direct me to a package that will let me create cascaded popup menus in X windows.  For reasons of portability the package should not rely on any X toolkit other than XLib and the XT Intrinsics.  Something written in C++ would be nice too. Thanks

1,I checked the FAQ on this first and no luck.. I need to convert the R5 Tree widget for use with xview v3.0. The problem is the fact that xview uses their own event loop system and I was wondering if anyone had any tips (or converted source) on converting these pups. Thanks Sean. (wipeout+@cmu.edu)
1,Hi! I've just installed the new XArchie 2.0.1 and it all works fine except: on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the program don't work at all but on the BW terminal it works fine. I can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc but that doesn't give the neat-o change when busy action. (Other programs with similar actions e.g. xmail xbiff work fine.) The X-interface author George Ferguson suggests it might be a problem with the X intrinsics but isn't willing to hack around to fix it himself. But I know zero about X programming so I don't think I can find it. Does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem?

1,Our group is interested in using a 'pixmap' format for multi-colored icons/buttons etc that is easily converted to and from other format from 'resource' files. Using pbmplus we can easily move to/from Xpm to our other environments of MS-Windows and OS/2 PM :-(. We were wondering if Xpm or some other format is under consideration to be used as a standard by the X consortium for R6 as we would prefer to use whatever will be best supported by X. Along the same subject line is the reason the standard X pixmap is not used because it doesn't have an associated colormap and other attributes? or is it more involved? just wondering why there aren't editors for pixmaps out there for the 'original' format. Email replies preferred. Thanks in advance. -- John Sigler Texas Instruments email: sigler@hp750.itg.ti.com Standard disclaimers go here.
1,Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists --------------------------------------------- Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list.  Similarly there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum for SCO products in general. With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO newsgroups many current contributors including those who have been active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.* hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide. biz.sco.{opendesktopgeneralannounce} were newgrouped May 1 1991 in accordance with accepted procedure within biz.  Given the content this change relocated the opendesktop newsgroup to a more proper place within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new announce and general groups.  On Aug 1 1991 the former sco-list@uunet.uu.net became scogen in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions. biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1 1992 to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix UNIX and OpenDesktop specific binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are moderated with moderator and submissions information and policy outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups. Respecting USENET etiquite these newsgroups are _not_ gated to mailing lists but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts. biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14 1992 to provide a discussion area for the readers writers and publishers of SCO Magazine. Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed you are now able to subscribe to the following: Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription ---------                    ------------------------- biz.sco.opendesktop          scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.general              scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.announce             scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.sources			<none> biz.sco.binaries		<none> biz.sco.magazine	     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP as do many archive sites. If after having explored all options you are still unable to receive biz.sco.* as news you may subscribe to the mailing lists. The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion mailing lists so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email. Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate mailing list subscription address above including in the message body: Add: subscriber_address		-eg- Add: your_logname@site.do.main  -or- Add: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled the same way simply substitute Delete: for Add: ensuring that you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list subscribers receive how to post to the mlist article submission information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive an acknowledgement within a few days check your routing and try a test message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases it's likely that someone somewhere is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do the same with mailing list traffic) and you'll want to resolve your connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.  Mailing list subscriptions are free subject to whatever arrangements you may have with the site(s) feeding you. Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists this indicates that we are no longer able to find a working route to your site.  We loose a handful of subscribers this way each month.  If this happens to you please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site. What's in the newsgroups (and mailing_lists where applicable): biz.sco.opendesktop: Technical questions and answers and informative postings relating to past present and future implementations of the SCO OpenDeskTop operating environment and it's various bundled components. biz.sco.general:     Questions answers and comments on SCO products in general and of course resulting discussions. biz.sco.announce:    SCO and SCO Developer product announcements of interest to current and future users of SCO products and to SCO developers resellers and distributors. (moderated followups directed to biz.sco.general). biz.sco.sources:	SysV or BSD source code for useful programs and utilities modified to compile and run with various incarnations of SCO Xenix UNIX and/or OpenDesktop. biz.sco.binaries:	Binary packages compiled from SCO compatible source code often from source posted in biz.sco.sources and often installable using the SCO custom utility. biz.sco.magazine:	Interaction between the SCO Magazine readers writers and publishers. You should always endeavour to post your article to the most applicable newsgroup.  For example posting your ODT question to the general newsgroup will preclude your question and answers to it from being saved in the public ODT archives.  Appropriate crossposting is allowed. The undersigned is solely responsible for administration of the biz.sco namespace.  Suggestions for additional biz.sco.* newsgroups and/or mailing lists should be emailed to the address below. -- Ed.

1,Hi Could some please tell me the errors of my ways. I am trying to update a drawable. This drawable happens to be a Pixmap on a button. The problem is that after I do the : XClearArea(XtDisplay(m_usr[0])XtWindow(m_usr[0]) 80 8 40 40 True); This appears to work. I then do sprintf(tmp_strR=%d++fun); XDrawString(XtDisplay(m_usr[0]) bmaps[0] my_gc 78 10 tmp_str (strlen(tmp_str)) ); The problem is that the new info is drawn but the old info is still there. Even if I pass XClearArea a False and see it clear when it redraws the new info the old info is still there. Help Please!!!

1,We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs. These programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps: - use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data otherwise block (new data comes quite often) - use msgop to check for messages and if true read them otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often) - update the display according to latest data and messages. We typically have several of these running in windows plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag. Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run. Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into. O'Reilly Vol IV Ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also how to add workprocs that are run during idle time. We can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc. The problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate. Neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt. The unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready. We want that for the X main loop except not file i/o. Any suggestions or examples most welcome! We run SGI Personal Iris and Indigo systems. Morris Hirsch aka morris@sg25.nusc.navy.mil or 401 841 7800

You have to run up the window heirarchy (using XQueryTree()) until you get to the root window.  Now this is not so simple because some window managers slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window so be sure to take that into account for further calculations. Calculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using XGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION. Remember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window so the windows xywidthheight must be adjusted accordingly. All of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the window-manager is using. Now to place the new window you have to use the same numbers to calculate where you want to place it because the window-manager will re-parent it on the OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly). DISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory and I no longer have the code.  But I did get it working under several window managers correctly.

1,I have been using a HDS X-terminal and really like it. What is really powerful is that it can run the X server without running a window manager. One can then run a special client X program called a window manager either (1) run motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network traffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlook from some home place (like a sparc or vms). This is powerful especially since I can exit one window manager (without killing windows) and then start up another manager. (Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in one manager and not the other). Well the question is: On a sparcstation running openlook does anyone know how to break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? Basically I want to run only the server and go somewhere else to run the window manager. --- Please respond my e-mail (as well as posting) because of the large volumes in window.X) Thanks. -- Scott Moody   (206) 773-4313   There are no answers .. just cross references scott@shuksan.boeing.com uunet!bcstec!shuksan!scott

1,I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from: :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100 to: :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85 I determined that my 19 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by resolution. However this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely. After some research I believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by Family Weight Slant and Pointsize.  I believe that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my path the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts but not for the family I am using (Helvetica). I think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance the command xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font). The command xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path). Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi and that it can generate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a resolution X appears to pick a stupid default. Is this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so why?  Is there anything I can do to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about my resolution and specify a single font path (75 or 100 not both). This would at least make my app consistent but I like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: Yup thats an inch.  Anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts I can use?

So use XCreateColormap() with the proper visual and use it in SetWinAttrib (and don't forget the mask!). And the inevitable caveat: I usually use widgets setting the visual and colormap resources rather than direct X routines so I could be wrong. But I think this is the general difficulty.

1,I've installed many X apps and have that many of them Imakefiles that have lines startingwith XCOMM in them. When I do a xmkmf to create the Makefile the Makefile also has the XCOMM (comment?) lines in them. I always have to edit out these lines because the make command barfs on them. I was wondering what these lines were for and what I might be doing wrong that causes the make command to dislike them. Thanks!

Thanks. The x3270 at export.lcs.mit.edu supposedly does.  I use another x3270 that was cleaned up by Brian Ward <ward@math.psu.edu> which adds better color support and cleans up _lots_ of bugs as well as cut&paste. I just put it on export.lcs.mit.edu as x3270v2.65beta.tar.Z. --Dave -- System Administrator Penn State Population Research Institute End of article 2565 (of 2565)--what next? [npq]

Several of us are having problems with xv-3.00 and in particular I have issues with all the fixes that have so far been made to the Imakefiles and xv.h.

1,Dear Netters: Could you mail the source code of the book: Advanced X window application programming by Johnson and Reichard TO ME? If you need any source code just ask me. Thank you very much! Sincerely Zeng Qiyong. -- ZengQiyong. SUNY at Buffulo
1,Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice I would say that the shareware notice is unenforceable.  All you need to do is make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed under the first part of the copyright notice.  Of course this would be circumventing the author's wishes on the subject but I'd say if you're not going to pay him no matter what you'd be on relatively safe ground with that approach...  In fact given the internal contradictions of the copyright notices I'd guess none of it could ever be enforced but not being a lawyer I can't be positive. Regardless the fees he's asking are not excessive and I would encourage anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible.  Even though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the author it would be reasonable to do so to support his efforts if nothing else. - Brad -- Brad Daniels		`	|  If money can't buy happiness daniels@neosoft.com		|   I guess I'll have to rent it.

1,Frequently-asked questions about the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface. If your question isn't here please try (at *least*) man openwin man xnews man 7 xview and looking in the appropriate manuals listed in the Bibliography below before posting to the comp.windows.open-look comp.windows.x or alt.toolkits.xview newsgroups and/or their corresponding mailing lists. Special Notes: * I have not updated this FAQ for the recently-announced OpenWindows 4 due to ship later this year. * Yes Sun is moving to Motif along with all of COSE.  But the Motif to which they move will be a new Motif with some of the OPEN LOOK UI features added. * Yes OpenWindows 4 will use DPS instead of NeWS.  NeWS is dead. This means TNT is dead too. * XView and OLIT will be supported but probably not enhanced after the next release.  I don't know if there will be a source release of XView 3.1 or not. * The COSE Environment will include at least some of Sun's DeskSet ported to Motif.  Look for Calendar Manager and Mailtool at least. * Yes the new Mailtool will be MIME-compliant. Frequently Asked Questions for X11 are posted to comp.windows.x monthly.

Subject: Bibliography -- books manuals journals papers beer-mats Subject: Getting this File Revision History Recent Changes Subject: Terminology: OPEN LOOK OpenWindows X11 XView OLIT MOOLIT Motif @ What is OPEN LOOK? OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). A GUI determines the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of windows buttons and scroll-bars how you resize things how you edit files etc. The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified developed and maintained jointly by Sun Microsystems and AT&T (or USL?). See Also: Bibliography @ What is OpenWindows? OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Specifications.  It's compatible with the X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems. It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors. OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews after the program used to start it and the main executable itself respectively. It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook' as these terms are either wrong or apply to something else. A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5000 for the server plus about $25000 for DeskSet and another $40000 for ToolTalk. The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are: SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0 Solaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0 Solaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1 See Also: Mixing X11 and OpenWindows Where can I get it? @ What are OLIT XView and TNT? These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary: OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system; it used a widget set and was probably the easiest for people who were already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a division of AT&T now owned by Novell) who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.). Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing you will probably want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or anything else that uses subclasses. [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference] XView is Sun's toolkit for X11 written in C.  XView is similar in programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help migrate source code from SunView to XView.	 XView is often said to be the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows. The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows and full source is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere). The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0. Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be included in the next release of OpenWindows unlike NeWS. On the other hand the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much attention from Sun in the future as OLIT. The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows. The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0 but Sun are committed to supporting the API at least until they stop NeWS support some time later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail. You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing. Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT however. The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++ class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3 and presumably V3.0.1 since the release mentions that it works on Solaris 2. UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!). @ Where does Motif fit in? It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that is being developed by OSF.	It has a `look and feel' reminiscent of Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non- commercial Motif toolkits available although the Motif source is sold reasonably cheaply by OSF.	Although Motif is currently available on more platforms than OpenWindows the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly used on many more machines simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a large installed base. Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable. @ What is MoOLIT? MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V Release 4.2. Contact: Joanne Newbauer jo@usl.com (908) 522-6677 @ What about that Display PostScript thing? Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously being harder to use as I understand it.  The only real advantage it has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller being generally less complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine. Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work; what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen. Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems the DPS extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard. (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts available however) Subject: Window Managers -- olwm olvwm @ What are olwm and olvwm? They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows on the screen and for managing the user's interaction with the windows. Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager. It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations and you can also get the source by ftp since Sun donated it. Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen with the currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.	 You can move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it. Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib directory; there are three patches). @ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm? Yes.  If you use twm for example or mwm you won't be able to use the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm and you (probably) won't see the footers some windows use to display certain messages. If you use twm you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run under olwm. For twm put this in your $HOME/.twmrc: LeftTitleButton target = f.delete where target is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps. Alternatively try # Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm LeftTitleButton :menu = f.menu OL.menu menu OL.menu { Quit         f.delete } For mwm you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told). See the manual page for your window manager (twm etc). Subject: OpenWindows Terminals and Other Displays @ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal? The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView NeWS (PostScript) and X11. This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems. Unfortunately it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS or SunView support and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes pageview in particular. You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open- Windows display and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones) will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about fonts not being found.  If so see the Fonts section below. If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal you may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help. Subject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows @ What configuration files do I need to know about? .xinitrc and .xsessionrc The first time you run OpenWindows a .xinitrc file will be created in your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists you might have to edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files you have to another directory and then merge the old and new files. If your site uses xdm you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file. .openwin-init .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use. Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an X terminal you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C shelltool -C xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's contool program so that system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen. Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc. .Xdefaults You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular it is a good idea to include at least: OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true *Input: TRUE These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it. Props the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default root menu under olwm or olvwm writes your choices into .Xdefaults. Don't put comments in .Xdefaults since `props' deletes them. .startup.ps This is the NeWS user profile file read by OpenWindows (actually xnews) on startup.	 This is documented in the NeWS programming manual near the back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change the keyboard repeat rate although you must be very careful since a syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up at all or will get broken in strange ways.	The NeWS manual gives code that is both incorrect and insufficient. WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3. Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see the man page for xset (man xset and xset -help) for more information. Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of about a third of a second (300000 microseconds) and a repeat rate of twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime is the delay between keys sent and thus doesn't include the time to process each key which is probably higher on my 4/1

These are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the performance of your workstation. Well more hardware isn't always an option and I wonder if more hardware is always even a necessity. This FAQ list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X Windows on your workstation WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE. Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts. This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation. However they are outside the scope of this document. [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system performance might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook System Performance Tuning by Mike Loukides.  IMHO it contains a well-written comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.] ----------------- Table of Contents ----------------- 0.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few months old (see the Last-modified date above) you should probably locate the latest edition since the information may be outdated.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions document. Its focus is on general X information while this FAQ concentrates on performance. The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed but only with regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be: Use X11R5 it is faster than R4. (Please see the X FAQ for complete details). --------------- Window Managers --------------- There are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager. A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move. Also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ The X Server ------------ Which Server? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. If you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome X11 server. On my Monochrome Sun I haven't noticed much difference between the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ] How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system X should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler. You can expect to get *very* large speedups in the server by not using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market. Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock() function call but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try. [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com) Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my .xclients script to do this logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core though. This sounds crazy but I have confirmed that it works! Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of why this works which I have summarized here: When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU and more importantly memory.  If you put a sleep in there you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up. Similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts: toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this initialization is done (The process has reached a steady state) the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources This is most definitely a Your Mileage May Vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered: available RAM local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc. Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & I've experimented with: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 3; exec xterm ) & (sleep 4; exec xterm ) & I've even tried: (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ] All of these yielded fairly comparable results and so I just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity.  You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you'll get speed increases in load-up time. One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small one large one roman whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server.  This will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au) Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ] eg: My main xterm font is 7x13 so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since I don't normally use 8x13 I've eliminated one font from my server. Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): Keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs. If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts use a font server. About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) One suggestion: In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true Then separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH: setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N [ The comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.] So when xterm launches it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name. This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com) Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov) and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.] This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits: - Easier to maintain / more usable. - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn`t have to load all your resources. - Applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. It also has drawbacks: - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an application's resource database you just need to re-run the application without having to xrdb again. - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not. WATCH OUT FOR THIS!! I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file which cpp stripped out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file. The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy e.g. ``#ifdef COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management. - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For example neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults. - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .Xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that I seldom use. Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In that situation rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to <hostname>:0.0 where <hostname> is the name of your workstation you should set your DISPLAY variable to unix:0.0 or :0.0.  By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.

1,Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can help me with. I create a window and I want it to have some background color say red and draw an oval in it. Further when I resize the window I want to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it is larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000. My problem is this: when I resize the window only the original part of the window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else is a grey..the oval tries to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it but it only shows up in the region that was the original size of the window when created. For example I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I resize it to 400x400 the only part that has any color drawn into it is is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval only shows up in that 200x200 area. What am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window? Second question: Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are??? Thanks Chris

Next type cat file1 file2 > file then uudecode file and zcat xrastool1.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -. Read the README file for instructions on how to proceed from there. Enjoy! Derek P.S. The source is also available for anon ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib/ directory. If there is enough demand a static binary will be provided for those without the XView libraries or include files. ----------------------------------------------------------- | Derek C.

1,Hello everybody out there ! I'm trying to compile X11R5pl23 and Motif 1.2.1 on a HP running HP-UX 8.05. But it' seems to be not very succesful because I have only hp.cf config-files for HP-UX 7.0. I tried standard cc and X was compiled with a lot of warnings. The motif applications are compiled quite well but they won't run. I receive the XKeysymDB error which is reported in FAQ but I cannot fix it. The XKeysymDB-file is at the right location and it works fine under SunOS. Probably I have started the compilation Prozess only with a wrong config-file. Please help me !

1,Some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need and it seems that someone out there just might have done it  already  and can point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is: Given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the data  is  arriving  over a slow link or the $DISPLAY is across a slow link) they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the picture  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus the picture might first be generated in 1/4 resolution with each  4x4  square  of pixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next each 4x4 square would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be painted. Since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side of a slow link the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted as  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a small  bitmap  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the magnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X server  can help.  That is when a window is opened is there a way to ask that a filter program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the only  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process (Permission denied ;-) and have it open a local window? It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up such  a  program  remotely and then accepts bitmaps compressing each one by some amount and sending them to the remote program to  expand. But  if  there is something that X itself can do to help it's be nice to hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs  but  if  it's  there  I obviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty tool available that packages it all we might want to get a copy. Oh yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  build demos  that  can  show such things as If this were run across say a 4800-bps link this is how fast the pictures would appear.  Then  the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for. -- If the auto industry were like the computer industry a car would  now cost $5 would get 5000 miles to the gallon and at random times would explode killing all its passengers.

Ghostview is a postscript previewer that uses ghostscript. From the ghostview README: Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript. Ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4. Brief list of features: - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring Conventions. - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments. - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures. - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our European friends. - Scrollbars appear when necessary. - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments. - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait Landscape Upside-down and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction). - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale or color on a Color monitor.) - Ability to mark pages for printing or saving.  (Good for people that printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.) - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution (1 display dot = 1 printer dot). The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people are encouraged to use in other programs. Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from: prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z From the ghostscript README: ***************************************************** * This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. * ***************************************************** ******** ******** An overview of Ghostscript ******** ******** Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides: - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language which very closely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the Ghostscript language. The Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely in C with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms. Currently Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform families: - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA VGA SuperVGA or compatible graphics under MS-DOS 3.1 3.3 or 5.0; - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11 release 3 4 and 5 including Sun-3 Sun-4 Sun-386i Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix; H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2; Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo; - Sun workstations (Sun-3 SPARC Sun-386i) running SunView; - VAX VMS with X11R3/4/5 gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler version 3.1 or later is required).

May I humbly suggest DESQview/X? (Of course I'm biased...) DESQview/X is a multitasker for DOS computers that uses a standard X11R4 server as it's display mechanism. DOS applications and Microsoft Windows standard mode are converted on-the-fly to X-protocol allowing you to display them or any R4 compatable X-program from any machine on the net to display to the PC's local display (or to any other display on the net). Free tools are available for devloping X-applications for the DVX platform; many X-programs have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or no modifications. (Often you only need to create a new makefile!)

If you already own all the clone equipment then there are lots of such programs (see a current copy of Unix World Magazine). *BUT*  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone. (From experience).  You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this is a new install.  The performance will be at least four times better. In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use.  On top of that they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4MB RAM ethernet card very high performance graphics card GOOD monitor server software TCP/IP for clone software mouse keyboard etc etc etc.... you spend a whole lot of $$$$). I can get 15 Tektronix XP11 terminals for under $900 and the performance is over 80000 Xstones..... -- /--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ | Mark A.

1,I've spent the past week tearing my hair out trying to get the output of a piped tail -f to end up in a widget.  I've managed to make it work in some ugly ways but either a) X blocks on the tail and won't allow user input b) the tail -f functions like just tail and doesn't follow the expansion of the file c) the tail -f doesn't die after I've closed the pipe and destoryed the widget or d) pclose() blocks forever waiting for tail to die. I _know_ this code has to exist.  Anybody have it?  A general popen() case would be perfered but at this point I'll take anything...

1,I've written an application for SparcStation 2 GX+ under OpenWindows 3.0. The application uses XView stuff to create my window and the SUN XGL graphics library for rendering into the Canvas. The application does real-time 2-D animation but it does not update the the display fast enough. I'm using notify_set_itimer (XView call) to periodically kick off my update routine and it's not happening fast enough. I want it to update 25 times / second. It's only doing about 11. Also it appears to be compute bound because if I run anything else while my appplication is up the update rate slows down even more. Any ideas ? Thanks.
1,I'm running HP-UX 8.07 with HP VUE 2.01 and I need a hardcopy of the login window (the one asking  for login and password) to include in a manual. I have tried: xwd -display hostname:0 -root -out login.xwd from a login on a remote terminal but it doesn't work. Xwd seems to wait for the window server but the window server doesn't answer. Any suggestions? I must use xwd because I don't have access to ftp and I can't obtain another program to grab the screen.

I'm running Linux and XFree86 on a 33Mhz 486DX with 4MB of RAM (8MB swap) and it runs just fine.  Its a lot better than some of the crappy old Xterminals in the labs at school anyway. You could probably outfit a 386SX with a minimal Linux/X setup for $900 and be better off than with an Xterminal. IMHO.

1,How can I draw an object of a specified color over objects of varying colors and then erase it without having to redraw everything else? What's happening is this If I draw it using GXcopy it is drawn in the specified color.  If I erase it using GXcopy with foreground and background reversed it erases whatever it overlayed.  I then need to redraw all of the items it crossed.  Yuch. If I draw it using GXinvert it is drawn in a random color - nothing resembling what I requested.  It properly restores the color of underlying objects in erase mode. What's the solution? -- Scott K.

1,Hi I have a lots of problems using XView (libraries Release 3.2) in order to do the following: + I want to create a MODAL Dialog which block the program flow (a syncronous dialog ala Macintosh)  as the Notice Panel does but with Text Item List Item and other XView objects. + The MODAL Dialog also must allows the Timer to be called (why Notice doesn't do that?). The problems are: - Using the xv_window_loop functions most XView objects dont work (as the List Item) and the timers aren't called. - With the notify_dispatch explicit I have problem because: ...never attempt to do direct dispaching from within a callback routine... as say the XView Programming Manual (Third Edition) on page 486 (uhm... I know this number!!! :->). But I need to do dispatching just inside a callback routine! Help me please!!! Thanks in advance --- Giovanni P.S.

The binaries available are for the sun3/50 but the author says it could be used on most architectures and he does have a 'do-it-yourself' type distribution.

1,I am planning to convert my Motif 1.2 app from pixel to font units which would all be set in the app's resource file instead of hard coded in the program. However the word here is from people who tried this already that for some unknown reason XmForm offsets placed in the resource file are still interpreted in pixel units forcing people to code those offset font units into the program. Can somebody confirm this? Thanks Joe Pannon pannon@bcsfse.ca.boeing.com
1,Ok I'm being driven batty. Trying to create popup-menus (ie. button3 press and a menu appears).  I would really like to use the standard Athena classes to achieve this goal but for my best attempts I cannot get the menus to come up without using a MenuButton as the parent of the widget tree.  I know this should be possible to to with an XtPopupSpringLoaded() and a little twiddling but something is escaping me. -- name       : David Koblas                 domain: koblas@netcom.com affiliation: Extra Mile Consulting	   phone: +47 (83) 38663 quote: Time has little to do with infinity and jelly donuts.

1,Hi folks I'm trying to compile xfig 2.1.7 on a SS1+ running SunOS 4.1.1 and OW 2.0 and I'm having a little trouble with make/imake.  Specifically make bombs when it needs to use any Xaw file.  This isn't surprising since X11 files on Suns with the standard OW 2.0 distribution are in various places under /usr/openwin (Xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/Xaw !!) Actually the real problem is that I know squat about imake and I don't know how to tell imake where the X11 files are.  I can see from the Makefile that it's looking in the wrong places but the first line of the Makefile reads # Makefile generated by imake - do not edit! Help!  Is there some way I can edit the Imakefile to tell it where to look?  (I have set DEFINES = -DOPENWIN_BUG as it said to in the README file.) Email and post are both fine. Thanks in advance Dave

1,Hi! I have a question which is not directly related to X Screen Saver. What X Screen Saver does is to blank the screen if it has been idle for some time.  I don't want my screen to go blank but to get locked or call xlock program. Is there a parallel call to XSetScreenSaver() which locks my screen or call my lock program after certain amount of idle time?  Or is there a way to find out how long the server has been idle?

I highly recommend Starnet's Micro-X.  They have versions for DOS and Windows with support for PC/TCP or the Clarkson packet drivers.

1,An application we *must* use requires upper-case input.  I'd like to be able to simply move my cursor into the window where that application is running (just a text window xterm or some such) and have everything I type be entered as ALL CAPS.  When the cursor is in any of my many other windows I want to automatically return to normal functionality.  I have point-to-type set. Is there a way to do this in X (specifically OW 3.0 on SPARCs)?  Is there a way to mess with .Xdefaults to make a category of window do this?  Any hints would be most appreciated.  I program in C but not X although I can pick up somthing that's not too involved. Thanks kindly. -- Kevin Weinrich     Computer Sciences Corp. kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov

1,Xm++/CommonInteract    Another User Interface Development System ------------------- If you would like to implement X-Toolkit applications with C++ in a style like this... // mini sample application ///////////////////////////////////// class Test : public XmWindow { void cmd(char*); void quit(void*); public: Test() : XmWindow(Xm++ Test Window) {} void initialize(); }; void Test::initialize() { XmDropdownMenu* menu = createDropdownMenu(); menu->addLabel(&File); menu->addItems( Entry(Menu Item &One CB(Test::cmd)) Entry(Menu Item &Two CB(Test::cmd)) NULLENTRY); menu->addSeparator(); menu->addItem(	Entry(E&xit CB(Test::quit))); addSubpane(Edit myEdit); edit(myEdit)->setText(Hello World.); } void Test::cmd(char* n) { edit(myEdit)->setText(n); } void Test::quit(void*) { exit(0); } void XmApp::initialize() { (new Test)->initialize(); } /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ...then continue reading (contents of the current release's README): Xm++ is a user interface framework for the C++ language built upon X11 and the X-Toolkit. It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets. Xm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set now support for the Athena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both environments without changes although many nice features are only available when using Motif. In some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing a ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows) but never tries to replace it - data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated in rare cases. Xm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to encapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many ideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version which provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications (in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-). Top level objects in Xm++: * 'Windows' 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw * 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this distribution) Controls (children of top level objects): 'staticText' 'staticImage' 'pushButton' 'checkBox' 'radioButton' 'edit' 'listBox' 'comboBox' 'groupBox' 'paneArea' 'drawing' 'toolBar' The staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap format) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text. Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects. CommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides components for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system (research project of our institute in 1991) an approach to define a software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound alternative input devices). If you are interrested look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS Publications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be our paper about CommonInteract (but be aware that it is our 'state of the art' from 1991). CommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was used to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing primitives (lines rectangles circles...) but we plan to extend it to support bitmaps and some controls also. Known problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always redraws the whole window even after minimal changes like selecting an object) this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed. About this first release: Xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here for smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think I can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications for any non-critical purposes. CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems to be stable and can be used for experimental applications. Platforms: this release was compiled and tested on: HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07 SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1 PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6 Caution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T standard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or above (the next release will be tested with both compilers).

1,I am just beginning to try using the Athena toolkit and am having some problems getting started.  I think that some files are missing on the system but there is the possibility that they are just in a different directory.  When I try to link my program it can't find XtInitailize XtRealizeWidget XtMainLoop XtCreateManagedWidget or commandWidgetClass.  I've included Intrinsic.h and Command.h.  I also had a problem on compile with XtNcallback but replaced that with a NULL in order to compile and see if there were any other problems.  I haven't used a toolkit before and this is simply an example I got from the manuel.  Can someone tell me where I might look for these calls that is in what file not what directory they are supposed to be under because the system manager doesn't believe in standard directories and generally does things his own way.  (I am using UNIX) Thank you for your assistance. T. J. Adamsson

If you don't do this the >cursor will be hard to track when in motion. You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z. We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned. You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver- tical line cursors smaller block cursors) turn on and off blinking set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok enough advertising. I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect but from the memories I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do what we wanted (mostly the blinking text) I'd say it won't be easy since xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to X10). The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned you'll have to show the cursor directly after it has moved or people will become confused. Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you do anything on screen anyways this isn't very complicated. You'll just have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after it's mapped. As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new release for over six months now but unfortunately we're drowning in work. But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much I'd say whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version. As is emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else than a csh. There is a fix to this which is very short (remove one line of code). I'll put this on export today.

1,Hello I have a problem with X11R5 on a Sun386i an I hope that someone can help me with it. I've built X from the MIT sources after applying all patches I have got (I think 23). Building was easy. After installing everything I started X but nothing happened but the screen and the keyboard freezed the machine seemed to hang. I loged in from another machine an found the Sun386i running well. 'ps' told me that there's a X-server and a xterm running. And with some experimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing ^D I blindly hit the xterm endet the session and got my prompt back. I guess it's a device problem but I did not find the correct device yet. I've got a Sun386i with a b/w framebuffer (ACE-6 0688 94V-0 Rev 53) SunOS 4.0.2 and ROM 4.4. Please help me. I'm able to run clients on the Sun and send the output to other machines but that's not what I did it for. Thanks in advance Stefan
1,I need some advice regarding monitor to use with Xfree86. I have an ET4000 based graphic card with 1 Meg of memory. I know this card is supported in Xfree86 because a friend of mine has one of these in his PC. His monitor is 17 colour capable of displaying 1280x1024 resolution. I cant afford this kind of expensive monitor. I heard from somewhere that Xfree86 requires multisync monitor with minimum horizontal scan frequency of 60KHz. Is this true? I would only like to use Xfree86 at resolution of 800x600 in 256 colours and so was thinking of buying a cheap 14 SVGA monitor. Interlaced (Cheap)14 SVGA monitors only have have maximum horizontal scan frequency of about 38KHz. Will this kind of monitor work with Xfree86? Please reply by email.

Color makes it not apples/apples too. Xterminals provide better price/performance than PCs.  You can make a PC much cheaper and perform much worse and you can make PC's perform great and cost more.

1,Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library. For Network discussion... Color Coordination... I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no one responded at all. The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly you will soon find that the workstations color table devotes itself solely the window manager icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead of applications that actually require the colors for proper working. ``Color needful applications'' such as :  Picture and graphic displayers Animation Real Time video Raytracers etc... . The following is a suggested color table for icons and general use. Icons Window Managers and general applications should follow this table or something like it UNLESS the application is ``color needful''. * for each primary color (redgreenblue) three colors EG: values   0 128 and 255. This results in  3 ^ 3  colors (27) representing most of the standard colors for use in icons. * two extra shades of grey EG: vales    (black) 0 64 128 196 and 255 (whitered...) * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager. This table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the workstation.

Methods to automatically passwd Authorization from one machine to another. This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current DISPLAY that is being used. 1/ Use rsh/rexec/on...  (the method in the xauth manual) Set up the your .rhosts file in the home directory on the remote machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands. xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh other xauth merge - This method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization. My vampire program also uses a variation however I wrap it as part of the remote command sequence  (EG:  xauth add $auth) Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required. The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also pass environment variables as well as the current directory.  You will however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for passing. Unless you are also have shared home directories. WARNING: Environment variables and command line arguments are visible in `ps' listing with the appropiate flags. As such passing authorization information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended. The recommended method as given in the manual (shown above) is safe from the view of other users. 2/ Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable. This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass the TERM environment variable to the remote host. It is then a matter of an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly. A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the actual call to rlogin is performed to include your DISPLAY and your authorization. On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or stty'ing your terminal. ---8<--- script for launching rlogin: #!/bin/sh # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display: if [ -n $DISPLAY ]; then case $DISPLAY in :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;; esac TERM=$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY` export TERM fi rlogin $* ---8<--- add to your .cshrc or .login if ( $?TERM ) then if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then echo $TERM | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge - setenv DISPLAY `echo $TERM | cut '-d&' -f2` setenv TERM    `echo $TERM | cut '-d&' -f1` endif endif ---8<--- xterm command to use xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname ---8<--- 3/ NFS. Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to. Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted then authorization is automatically passed Hoever you will still have to pass your DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means. IE: login host:       echo $DISPLAY > ~/.X11host remote host:      setenv DISPLAY `cat ~/.X11host` 4/ Finger for the info in a .plan file This involves encrypting the information into your `.plan' or `.project' and having the remote machine finger for the information. This has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering the user.  Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each individual.  IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known by others nor should it be easy to determine. A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone who is asking. This last method was developed last year by a second year here untill I explained to him the need for the encryption at which point he gave up this method. It is however a valid method. It is easer than (2) but less secure.

1,This is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking: I am attempting to add a working SaveScreen function to a new server.  I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly and through debugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0 which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen. My problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1 even after I have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys.  My question is:  what am I likely to be missing that would cause this problem?  I copied the basic design of my function from the existing versions: static Bool next_savescreen(scron) ScreenPtr scr; Bool on; { /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */ if (on != SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { nextSetLastEventTime(); } if (on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { /* Save user's current setting */ next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness(my_eventhandle); NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle 0.0); /* Blank the screen */ } else {											 /* Unblank the screen */ NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle next_save_screen_brightness); } return TRUE; } I can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the saver but I cannot find where it wakes up the server and unblanks the screen. Any tips/help would be appreciated.

1,I am using xnlock as the screensaver for a PC-based X server. However after an interval of no activity my X session ends. This does not happen when I use xscreensaver. My screensave command is fired up from my .xsession like this: xautolock -time 1 -locker xnlock -corners ++++ -cornerdelay 1 & My hypothesis is that xdm (I use xdmcp to start my X session) detects a period of inactivity from the server then terminates the session. However for some reason this does not happen with xscreensaver. Is there a workaround? I'd prefer responses via e-mail.

1,Hi I'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events so that when the program exits I can save the last known geometry in some sort of 'preferences' file. I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell: XtAddEventHandler(topLevelStructureNotifyMaskFalseconfigureCBmyData); This works fine and my callback is called whenever the window is resized or repositioned using the window manager (mwm). However when I'm just resizing the window using any resize handle on the window manager resize decoration the x and y are set to zero in the XEvent passed to the event handler callback.  I'm accessing the xconfigure structure like the X11 manual says.  (xev->xconfigure.x xev->xconfigure.y). The width and height memebers are correct. When I reposition the window using the window manager the xevent's xconfigure structure contains all the correct x y width height member settings. Q1: Anybody know why when just resizing the x and y are being set to zero? Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes? I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my application (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values for the x y width height resources.

1,I am writing a X-based dosemu which requires XKeyReleasedEvent. I found the keycode of XKeyReleasedEvent is wrong.   If I run the program on a Linux host(XFree1.2) with  DISPLAY set to the local Linux and to the Sun host (X11R5) the two keycodes from the two Xservers are different. Of course the keycode of XKeyPressedEvent is O.K. Can anybody verify this ?     Did I do anything wrong ?

But when I try to run 'startx' I get a strange response: My monitor goes into graphics mode and I get this big white rectangle on the screen - that's all! Nothing else!

1,Hi. I'm wonderring if it is possible to replace a single module as XKeybind.o in a shared library as libX11.so in Suns OpenWindows. I tried to RTFM but I didn't get any wiser that way. Also can I do the same on an RS6000 machine running 3.2.2 (if it is possible at all). I know how to do it with real libraries (ar). I am trying to replace XLookupString in the delivered libraries with another that does a few special things. /Per -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Per Andersson - ppan@celsiustech.se (perand@stacken.kth.se on free time) Managing networks ( and occasionally SUNs) at but not speaking for: CelsiusTech AB J{rf{lla Sweden

The server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous though (see also DESQview/X which does this in its DOS windows).  Do you really want xterm to wake up every half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt? ++Brandon
1,After looking at the scaling code I realized the follwing: 1) My problem with the resolution 100x100 foints is due to an installation problem. 2) That the X server or font server will rescale the best font it can find to meet your requirements. This means that if you server return a response like the following -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1 You can ask for the follwogin: -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1 and it will generate it for you.  You should try to always use known pixel sizes. Bill Jones

1,Due it seems to Sun's crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes most standard (GNU and other) software won't compile out of the box (well tar file). Right now I'm trying to make ghostview. It complains it can't find X11/XaW/... so I just linked (ln -s) the files from /usr/openwin/share/include/X11 and now the ghoddam thing _still_ complains it can't find them. I still haven't been able to compile xdvi not no way. Has anyone _ever_ managed to get _anything_ normal to compile on a Sun (SunOS 4.1.3 and OpenWindows 3)? What's the trick I'm missing? I've even tried hard copying all the relevant files into the right places and every time there's some bit missing or it refuses to find it. ///Peter
1,I understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets: callbacks and actions The problem I face now is that I have a quite long piece of application code that performs a lot of drawing into a window. I want to connect this to a widget. No problem so far. I could use a callback function or an action to do this processing any events afterwards. But because the drawing takes some while I want the application code sequence to be able to be interrupted by events. Then I want to handle the events and resume with processing the application code at the point it was interrupted. It seems to me that this isn't possible but how can I give the user the impression that his inputs are immediately processed ? Has anybody an idea? Please answer via e-mail. Thanks in advance.

I looked >twice at porting emu to linux but stopped short becuse of the tty >part. Is there a `cleaner' version of emu that supports POSIX tty >explicitly? Hmm depends on how you define 'clean'. Jordan implemented the system dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for call it operating system types then you go ahead and write a include file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic implementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a OS flavor yet that is fully POSIX we haven't gotten around to really implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically for just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file tty_sun.i for example but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and every operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm sources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a couple of times this only uses up some disk space since only the drivers actually included from the toplevel include file will be compiled into emu. It shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully relies on the posix stuff but unfortunately I don't have a linux system available to me so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest you read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or questions contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu since we just don't have access to that many different systems.

1,When I changed from SVR4 to SVR4.2 on my Intel box I discovered that some of my SVR4 xclients such as xload etc would no longer work.

Both systems use X11R5. Thanks. Jack.

1,Thanks to Bruce Barnett who recommended xvttool and Bernward Averwald and Liam Quin who recommended modifying .Xdefaults to get the desired behavior for a *class* of xterms. In xvttool simply create a key file that looks like: a	A b	B c	C ... and specify said key file on the command line.  This will translate any input into any other (in my case lo-case to up-case).  Works great and you get a customizable button-pad on the right or left side. To use an xterm solution add to your .Xdefaults: capxterm*VT100.Translations: #override \ <Key>a: string(A)\n\ ... or: capxterm.vt100.translations: #override \n\ <Key>a: insert-string(A) \n\ <Key>b: insert-string(B) \n\ ... and invoke as: xterm -name capxterm Thanks loads! -- Kevin Weinrich     Computer Sciences Corp. kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov

And although > I would love to have most of the things mentioned here somebody has to write > it. What I'd like to see is this scenario: Each widget view whatever describes it's colors via a palette. Palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information. They are not directly tied to the object that uses them.  Palettes are held in the server.  A palette can accomadate up to the number of hardware color cells of color descriptors. When the input focus is in a particular widget that widget has access to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette.  ALL OTHER WIDGETS TRANSIENTLY GET THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION THAT CAN BE GENERATED BY A UNION OF THE COLORS FROM THE CURRENT PALETTE AND ANY FREE COLORS THAT ARE LEFT OVER. A widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel) into its associated palette. The bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server.

Use a workProc.  See XtAppAddWorkProc(3Xt). You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks (this is the hard part).  Then in the callback that starts the drawing you call XtAppAddWorkProc() to call your workProc the first time. Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean... TRUE when you are finished and FALSE when you want to keep processing.  If you return FALSE the workProc is automatically re-installed. Note that this method is better that using a time-out loop since events get processed in a more precedence-oriented manner.  If you are using the same Ada bindings I am however you are hosed and should look into XtAppAddTimeout(3Xt). ---------- Joe Hildebrand hildjj@fuentez.com Software Engineer Fuentez Systems Concepts (703)273-1447 Standard disclaimers apply

1,Hi netters: We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process #if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are. For example makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed by Sun) - namely Xos.h: #if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__) #       include <string.h> #       define  index   strchr #       define  rindex  strrchr #else   /* BSD && !__STDC__ */ #       include <strings.h> #endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */ Here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist under Solaris2. We also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code. We got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem. In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's distribution) mentions this problem: BUGS If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp  the  Berkeley  C preprocessor then makedepend will be compiled in such a way that all #if directives will evaluate to  true  regardless of  their  actual  value.  This may cause the wrong #include directives to be evaluated.  Makedepend should  simply  have its own parser written for #if expressions. Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us? Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply directly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary. Thanks in advance. *************************************************************************** *     Michael Turok                  *                                    * *  Information Resources Inc.       * E-Mail:  mlt@blues.infores.com     * *     200 Fifth Avenue               * Voice:  (617) 890 1100 ext.7531    * *  Waltham MA 02154 USA            * Fax:    (617) 890 4660             * ***************************************************************************
1,Hi there Do someone of you have a program for sending a key event to another window but it MUST appear in that window.... I have used xsendevent.tar package but it does not do that !!! For example if I get a program executing: -------------- #!/bin/sh read something .... .... echo $something .... .... -------------- and if I send the key event <KeyPress>a<KeyRelease>a to that window then I will get: something=a Thanks in advance. -- Gabriel Iban~ez C. gibanez@dcc.uchile.cl

Asher Yes Xhibition is for the X Window System.  The X Window System Conference remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen full and half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days provide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor exhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what folks can purchase today and you have a complete show focused on X11. Speakers at Xhibition 93 include: Bob Schiefler Lu Abel Mark Ackerman Paul Asente Doug Blewett Donna Converse Jim Fulton Oliver Jones Keith Packard Ralph Swick Doug Young and many others. Xhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional conferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of interest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object Management Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server technologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational; and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT. With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing applications for in-house or custom use a new 32-bit operating system from a player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many desktops and the price of computing power dropping its successor needs to be evaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT so must their developers and suppliers. The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information to the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference at Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide the *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX developers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has what you need for your application development or systems deployment this is the place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft get them to show you what you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development Kits- to bang on evaluate and generally to see for yourself. I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an Xhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a confusing place at the moment with UNIX COSE NT DCE CORBA and all of the other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion. -Aub Harden Technical Program Manager harden@ics.com X H I B I T I O N   The Conference and Trade ******    *****    Show for Corporate *      *       *    Software Development ******     *** *         *    201 Broadway ***     *****     Cambridge MA  02139 Windows on Distributed Computing June 7 - 11   San Jose CA xhibit@ics.com  uunet!ics.com!xhibit Voice: (617) 621-0060  Fax: (617) 621-9555 Presented by Integrated Computer Solutions Inc.

1,When attempting to connect to an SGI Indigo from a PC clone using a commercial X windows emulation package the X package hangs in a pre-login X screen mode.  The login box won't display.  Using the package in 'telnet' mode I can logon to the SGI and run any none graphic type things.  On the PC I get an error: Read error 0 on socket 1  (raw socket error) On the SGI in xdm-errors: I get a termination error when I kill the stalled screen on the PC On the SGI in SYSLOG: <date><time><SGI> xdm[#]:Hung in XOpenDisplay(<remote>:0 aborting                     :server open failed for <remote>:0 giving up I have all access control disabled (I believe SYSLOG message confirms this when I login on the SGI).  I believe I have the SGI set up properly as described in the X ADm. book by O'Rielly.... The X emul package tech support hasn't been able to solve the problem. So what I'm looking for is some suggestions on where to look for problems and possible tests to run to narrow down the questions. Thanks webster@ucssun1.sdsu.edu

Unfortunately it does.  I don't agree with the logic of NT at an X windows conference.

1,Is there an easy (ie via shell commands) way to tell what the DISPLAY environment variable is for any given client process?  Sometimes I can get what I want by typing ps -axe if: a. the client was invoked with a -display argument or b.

1,We have Suns running SunOS 4.1.3 and Openwindows 3.0 (X11R4). We have used Xvision on a PC setup to broadcast query to the UNIX xdm servers and allow a user to choose a UNIX client in which to login: xdm will then manage that display. I would like to do the same thing with xfree86 running under Linux but I don't know how. I don't want to hardwire the UNIX xdm to manage the PC displays as the PC's are not always running Linux (let alone xfree86). I would like the same setup as provided by Xvision. Can anybody help?

1,Yes we have the same problem with xinit.  The problems seems to come from the fact that the XOpenDisplay(:0) fails.

The problem was that after the course the students were good at programming in the artificial package but frustrated that they couldn't really use their skill for other work. --- Ken Mandelberg      | km@mathcs.emory.edu          PREFERRED Emory University    | {rutgersgatech}!emory!km    UUCP Dept of Math and CS | km@emory.bitnet              NON-DOMAIN BITNET Atlanta GA 30322   | Phone: Voice (404) 727-7963 FAX 727-5611

1,Hi all I've read the FAQ I've fiddled around but I am still having problems getting my poor old HP9000/300 to let me input/display characters above 127.  I have the following in my .Xdefaults: XTerm*Font     :   -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1 So I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm.  I have NOT set my LC_CTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it it tells me that that locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined or at least /lib/locale doesn't exist).  I can get some of the characters above 127 to print out but they are not where I'd expect them -- for example Alt-v does not produce a u umlaut.  This leads me to believe that the fault lies with the stty settings which are as follows: speed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef> intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^H; kill = ^K; swtch = ^@ eof = ^D; eol = ^@; min = 4; time = 0; stop = ^S; start = ^Q -parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crts -ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -iuclc ixon -ixany ixoff -ienqak isig icanon iexten -xcase echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh opost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel -tostop Anyway I've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks and any help anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.

I got a few requests asking for a summary so I'll attempt one here: Here's the ones I know of: Wind/U		- Bristol Technologies Hunter SDK	- Hunter Systems MainWin		- MainSoft LIBWXM          - Visual Solutions Hunter The company is going through some big changes.  I expect to eventually see the Hunter SDK pop up with a new name.  At the moment it is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info. Hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down. Visual Solutions LIBWXM is a product that I just heard about.  They don't yet support MDI or MFC.  Libwxm was used to port VisSim a mathematical modeling package.  Does native Motif Widgets like Wind/U from Bristol. Contact Carrie Lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info.  She's very helpful. MainSoft This translates Windows source to a Unix executable that can switch off between a Windows or Quasi-Motif look and feel at runtime.  They skip the Xt and Xm (Motif) X toolkit levels and go straight to Xlib.  They don't yet support MFC.  They're at 415 896 0708. Bristol This company that seems to be on the right track.  Wind/U uses Xlib/Xt/Xm to give a *real* Motif app.  They seem to be doing the most work in trying to support things like DDE Common Dialogs and more on the horizon. My contact there is knowledgeable responds to my email and wrote an example program for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles.

What is this link problem with libXmu on SunOS 4.1.[23]?

1,Hi I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) and X11R5 on a Sun4 (SunOS 4.1). Since I run X on both colour and black&white displays I need different values for the same resource so I want to use #ifdef COLOR in my application defaults files. However cpp is only invoked by xrdb and not when the resources are loaded on demand. Is there a proper solution to this? So far the only proper solution I've come to think of is to create 2 different files in my ~/app-defaults/ say XTerm and XTerm-color and set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color. But that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell command without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH). Furthermore I thought of using #include XTerm in XTerm-color. However for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color things are different on both machines. On a Sun the FIRST found resource is used (i.e. the one from XTerm the b&w one) while on an RS/6000 the LAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do about it? I have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH I can use %T %N %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults %N for the resource class but what do %C and %S stand for?

I for one am going because I too am curious about the technology. I think this is a great chance to learn about NT mainly because: - It will be presented in X's home turf. I believe that the attendees will mostly have X backgrounds (biases? :-); thus I expect that the NT presentations will face a tough audience. - I can be there in person to judge for myself whether or not NT is what it is hyped to be. This is as closely as I can get to in evaluating the NT technology without actually using it myself which I don't have the time to do. - If NT turns out to be a vapor technology and I get bored there will be many other interesting tutorials/presentations that I won't have to waste my time ... in California?!?  :-) Just my thoughts... -- Ik Su Yoo RRC-4F728 x5764 ik@leis.bellcore.com

1,I've just started messing with X Windows under Linux and I've run into this -<toolkit options> thing in the man-pages of a number of X clients. Where can I get a list of these options?  Is this only an xview thing? (If so would some kind soul show me how to set it up under Linux?)

Granted it's nothing to loose sleep over but this is Ethernet's tragic flaw: the more activity (especially lots of tiny activity) the more collisions happen and the performance gets exponentially worse...  I am just now opposing ANY kind of waste of bandwidth under Ethernet.  Although in a polling system it would not be so bad. -- /--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ | Mark A.

1,Help I've got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across the top (a toolbar).  I wanted to add eventhandlers to these pushbuttons on EnterWindowMask and LeaveWindowMask so that I can put up some descriptive text about the function of each pushbutton as the pointer crosses over it. I've done this fine but I've turned up the following problem: When the pushbuttons are sensitive I get callbacks on both of the above events but when they are not sensitive I only get callbacks on LeaveWindow events.  This seems odd.  I would expect this to be an all-or-nothing type of thing. Is this a bug?  If not can someone explain this behavior? thanks Mark

A hundred of them on a single ethernet might be >a problem but a couple dozen should be fine. Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem except over a wet string network. One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (and hence process switches) that it forces upon a host.  Actual measurements (hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user which can lead to 20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how many processes are needed for each character.) While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking process and does not add any transactions it will add something like 10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase in overhead especially as the application may have quite a large working set.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor there could be as many as 50. If you want to go there I wouldn't start from here! Nick Maclaren University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory New Museums Site Pembroke Street Cambridge CB2 3QG England.

1,Hi I've tried to get rid off XDM's ugly Login window by giving it a 'cool' backgroundPixmap ressource. As Login is derived from Core this should be possible. Anyway setting xlogin*backgroundPixmap:/a/b/c.xpm did not produce any message of the form 'cannot convert String to Pixmap' and explicitely registering such converter lead to nothing too.

1,Bristol Technology announces the availability of its HyperHelp(tm) and Xprinter(tm) demo for downloading. This demo showcases the two products in the form of a diagram editor called DE. Download the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself: o Complete on-line context sensitive help system. o Printing support for PCL5 and PostScript. o Rotated Text support! o Source code for the demo is provided. The demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9). There are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/Bristol directory: Sun     - sun4.demo.tar.Z (SunOS 4.x) HP      - hp700.tar.Z     (HP-UX 8 & 9) If you have any questions about the demo send an e-mail to: support@bristol.com. If you want another version of the demo (rs6000etc...) please send an e-mail to: info@bristol.com. Remember to use binary mode! What are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on...... --------------------------------------------------------- Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter. HyperHelp 3.0 ------------- HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context sensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one line function call application developers can access the full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on their development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF project and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility. This allows a documentation department to maintain a single set of help documents portable between MS Windows Motif and Open Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler! New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windowsa character based viewer segmented bitmaps SGML support and an improved History window. Xprinter 2.0 ------------ Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated printer support to their existing/new X based applications very easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the display and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code for drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for our demo and see Xprinter in action. If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support to your application Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology for UNIX SVR4.2. Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about HyperHelp and Xprinter. If you have any questions or comments send them to us at: info@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969. Happy demoing The staff at Bristol Technology

1,I am working for a company which has only one connection to the Internet. This is through a firewall gateway (unix workstation). I would like to be able to telnet to a host outside the company and set the DISPLAY to my PC which is running an X-terminal emulator (eXceed/W). The display can be set to the gateway workstation with no problem but when I set the variable to my IP address I get a Error: Can't open display message. This can't be that hard to work around can it? BTW I have no trouble running x-clients on local workstations (in the company) and having them display on my PC. -- Curtis Wahlgren
1,Any Tcpview-for-Sun users out there?  I pulled down the pre-compiled executables made for Sun for Tcpview but I'm getting a whole slew of the following types of error messages when I try to start it up: Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfActivate Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfActivate:ManagerParentActivate()' Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfCancel Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfCancel:ManagerParentCancel()' Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfSelect Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfSelect:ManagerGadgetSelect()' ... But I *know* I have those in my keysym: egrep osfActivate|osfCancel|osfSelect $OPENWINHOME/lib/XKeysymDB yields: osfActivate             :1004FF44 osfSelect               :1004FF60 osfCancel               :1004FF69 osfSelectAll            :1004FF71 and if I take *out* the osf lines from said XKeysymDB my copy of wscrawl (another Motif-compiled-for-Sun program) gives the same type of complaints as listed above. Any tips?  I'm mystified. -- Kevin Weinrich     Computer Sciences Corp. kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov

The atrocities committed by the Armenian volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties. The memoirs of many Russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these Armenian guerrillas which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of war then observed in such areas.[1] [1] Journal de Guerre du Deuxieme d'Artillerie de Forteresse Russe d'Erzeroum 1919 p. 28. : >honored me by reproducing my text.

For nearly one thousand years the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye. Today x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia. Today x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds. >You have now done so four times in a row.

And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey when they were expelled from Europe especially Spain by Saintly Christians and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up as most Americans have been in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition the condition of the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable. One readily reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate... He also stated that: they [Armenians] traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian invader; that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population. : >I want the documents of Jews in Latvia.

In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city of Van whose 33789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan on April 28 1915 Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake. Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves. With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.

Cambridge University Press London 1979 pp. 314-317. ...Meanwhile Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans with the president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response: 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the glorious Russian Army with their blood to serve the victory of Russian arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the Bosporus. Let with Your will great Majesty the peoples remaining under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new free life under the protection of Russia.'[155] Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies.

An Armenian state was organized at Van under Russian protection and it appeared that with the Muslim natives dead or driven away it might be able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient Armenian civilization. An Armenian legion was organized 'to expel the Turks from the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet.'[162] Thousands of Armenians from Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new Armenian state...By mid-July there were as many as 250000 Armenians crowded into the Van area which before the crisis had housed and fed no more than 50000 people Muslim and non-Muslim alike.[163] [162] Hovannisian Road to Independence p. 56; FOP 2488 nos. 127223 and 58350.

In 1941 while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943 this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher) who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination of the Jews. This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encore performance staged by the Armenians during WWI when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army. Furthermore as McCarthy put it the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia including t

G-d has nothing to do with it. Some of the land was in fact given to the Jews by the United Nations quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab absentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the partition of the Palestine mandate territory and as the result of defensive wars fought against the Egyptians Syrians Jordanians et al. *** > 2)Why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of > the inhabitants are not Jews and do not want to be part of Israel? First I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since  however I agree with those who claim the West Bank I think I can answer your question thusly: the West bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion to attack Israel which was a poor move seeing as how the Israelis promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable but it beats national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way one could ask why it is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs continues it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition there is the small matter of Jerusalem which is considered to be part of the West Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude like Yossi Sarid aren't going to propose giving up Jerusalem.

This is the latest from UPI Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told journalists Turkey was closing its air space to all flights to and from Armenia and would prevent humanitarian aid from reaching the republic overland across Turkish territory. Historically even the most uncivilized of peoples have exhibited signs of compassion by allowing humanitarian aid to reach civilian populations. Even the Nazis did this much.

The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because any system can solve it. The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine). I asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved. I assumed that was obvious but I won't repeat that mistake. Now that I have straightened that out I'm eagerly awaiting your reply. Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization) said it best when writing in his diary in 1940: Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal ^^^                  ^^^ of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country. The only solution is a Palestine at least Western Palestine (west of the Jordan river) without Arabs.... And there is no other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to transfer all of them; not one village not one tribe should be left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out. DAVAR 29 September 1967 (Courtesy of Marc Afifi) Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS charter (that's the english translations if you have other information I'd be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to a _private_ paper even older? I'm not going to get into the question if he wrote the above but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It's those who are willing to make a tabula rasa and start over and willing to give in order to get something back. We and our either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which). Well i can give you an answer you Master of Wisdom I will NOT suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem ! I think that is fair enough . No that is _not_ an answer since I asked for a system that could solve the problem. You said any could be used then you provided a contradiction.

So I should be very comfortable that 500000000 people want to convert me to Islam. Or to convert me to ANYTHING. There are many types of violence physical murder is only one. 'Trying' to convert is an insult. It's like trying to tell me that me and/or my God/my lack of God are just crap that I need a new 'converted' one. This does not apply for muslims only of course. Same for jews and for some friendly nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches and cheap booklets about some church .... And when the objective is (I think however that you are wrong) to convert everybody it's just a matter of time when violence will occur. Aren't we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of 'conversion related violence' ? Why not let 'the other more inferiour' people live as they wish and take care your business?. You do assume that they are inferiour (or their beliefs are) as long as you want to change their thinking. Dorin

I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who have the right for it. As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the current negotiations and the so-called peace process they are not against peace per se but rather for their well-founded predictions that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the same for Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of negotiations in Madrid and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying why are you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations. I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations what do they have to loose ? Arabs feel that the current negotiations is ONLY for legitimizing the current status-quo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and oranges. That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked. Just an opinion. Hasan

My 'k' key works overtime as it is just to Then what seems to be the problem? Did you ever read newspaper at all? PAINFUL SEARCH .. THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh. The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates. The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2000 dead. The State Prosecuter Aydin Rasulov  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  Hojali Disaster said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence. FranCois Zen  Ruffinen head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali most  of  them  civilians. We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy Mr Zen Ruffinen said. We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead. Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office. Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990. Those  nationalists the  Popular  Front finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia fell to the Armenians. Officially 184 people have so  far been certified as dead being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. This  is just a small percentage of the dead said Rafiq Youssifov the republic's chief forensic scientist. They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours. Of these 184 people 51 were women and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation including ears  noses breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed Mr Rasulov said. Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here six policemen there  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February. There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot. People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return. There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces. THE INDEPENDENT London 12/6/'92 HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago writes Hugh Pope. I'm still  wearing the same  clothes I don't have  any others the  51-year-old carpenter  said  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. I was wounded in five places but I am lucky to be alive. Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food without electricity for more than a month and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2000 to  3000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh. At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons  artillery  heavy machine-guns the lot Mr Sadikov said. Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town  down a hill through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side. To escape the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak. None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire Mr Sadikov said. Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died  including  his 67-year-old elder brother. I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat he said pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. We have never got any of the bodies back. The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation Alif  Hajief was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing Mr Sadikov said. Another hero  Elman Memmedov the  mayor of Hojali said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee. The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going Mr Sadikov said. I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock. Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed. Anyway the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women children and elderly people burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that they are doing it again at a different scale in fascist x-Soviet Armenia today. Source: Stanford J.

In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city of Van whose 33789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan on April 28 1915 Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake. Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves. With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.

I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia. Although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs I have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people well but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians however the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. I am now in Erzurum and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as well I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard but there is proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.

I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned and advised by Toynbee. If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians by massacring an alien population under their rule which constituted about 40% of their total population and they did it only within a time period of a little over two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population. Now I would like to ask you: Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to this one? And again I would like to ask you: Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands of Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a Final Solution to Turco-Tartar problems in Armenia is similar or not to the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution to Jewish problems?

But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920 the Armenian Government ordered incited assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race religion and national origin? By the way you still haven't corrected yourself. During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal the Armenian publication in Germany Hairenik carried statements as follows:[1] Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease and when it becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical operation the flow of blood is a natural thing. Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11 1983 published in the San Francisco Chronicle as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian. ...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum Turkey by Armenian neighbors bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors... Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war on his premise to grant them self government if in return the Armenians would help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Mr. Amarian! I don't need your bias. Signed Elihu Ben Levi Vacaville California. [1] James G. Mandalian 'Dro Drastamat Kanayan' in the 'Armenian Review' a Quarterly by the Hairenik Association Inc.

Then you must be living in an alternate universe. Where were they? An Appeal to Mankind During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter Universal Declaration of Human Rights Helsinki Agreements Human Problems International Forums documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated. The USSR's President government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace. The 140000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed hundreds of people killed thousands wounded. Some 200000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR their historical homeland. Together with them 64000 Russians and 22000 Kurds have also been driven out a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40000 Turkish-Meskhetians Lezghins and representatives of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations. One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR. We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated its territory culture  and history are trampled its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad and this defamation is spread over the whole world by Soviet mass media Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States. One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan. It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR. We are for a united indivisible sovereign Azerbaijan we are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade. But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the neighboring lands. The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent. But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion by their residence or other attributes? All people are brothers and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

The Armenians are Christians the Azerbaijanis are Moslems and Islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers. Besides at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people hundreds of thousands of refugees and gross violations of human rights. Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole thing has now gone entirely too far. >   Want to know what will bring the story in Armenia to the front >   page?

They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the plots the perpetrators and the underdogs. Report taken from The New York Times Tuesday March 3 1992 MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED AgdamAzerbaijanMarch 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan. The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and massacred men women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes. But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre. Scalping Reported Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them from retrieving more bodies. Women and children have been scalped said Assad Faradshev an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. When we began to pick up bodies they began firing at us. The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam Rashid Mamedov said: The bodies are lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this. Truckloads of Bodies Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh a Reuters photographer Frederique Lengaigne said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani bodies. In the first one I counted 35 and it looked as though there were as many in the second she said. Some had their head cut off and many had been burned. They were all men and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.

2,The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians #17 To the children of genocide: Send them away into the Desert This is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish wartime (WW1) governmental telegrams in translation entailing the orders for the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey. Generally these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior Talaat Pasha for example we have the following set regarding children: To the Government of Aleppo. November 5 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to the Armenians from Sivas Mamuret-ul-Aziz Diarbekir and Erzeroum [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem families and received as servants when they are left alone through the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect all such children in your province and send them to the places of deportation and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to the people. Minister of the Interior Talaat [1] To the Government of Aleppo. September 21 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans prolonging their lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us. Minister of the Interior Talaat [2] To the General Committee for settling and deportees. November 26 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their places of exile. Abdullahad Nuri. [3] To the Government of Aleppo. January 15 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is done through the ignorance of our real purpose or through contempt of it the Government will regard the feeding of such children or any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it purpose since it considers the survival of these children as detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received into the orphanages and no attempts are to be made to establish special orphanages for them. Minister of the Interior Talaat. [4] To the Government of Aleppo. Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with the caravans. Minister of the Interior Talaat [5] From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo. At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection it is not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by Armenians who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent away in compliance with our previous orders to Sivas. Minister of the Interior Talaat [6] In 1926 Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha verifying and rationalizing this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality the following: I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for its own interest and succeeds the world admires it and thinks it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done and I know I shall die for it. [7] These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's assassin Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these death march orders until 1986 during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians. For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society. If one were to examine the sample authentic text provided in the Turkish Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample it too would be a forgery!. In fact if any of the tests delineated by the Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or Persian/Arabic script one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery. Today the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill Istanbul Turkey just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey. This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian. - - - references - - - [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_ Aram Andonian 1919 pages 59-60 [2] ibid page 60 [3] ibid page 60 [4] ibid page 61 [5] ibid page 61 [6] ibid page 62 [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_ Halide Edip The Century Press New York (and London) 1926 page 387 -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | How do we explain Turkish troops on S.D.P.A.

2,DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1] Born 1972 Attended 9th Grade Middle School No. 17 Resident at Building 4/2 Apartment 25 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan] Really people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came home from school at 12 o'clock being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to Baku. When we left everything in town was fine. Life was the same as usual a few groups of people were discussing things soccer and other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first cousin's birthday my father my mother and I. We spent the day in Baku and on the 28th somewhere around 6:00 p.m. we got on the bus for home figuring that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day. When we were entering town near the 12-story high-rises our bus was stopped by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one not checking passports just going by the way people look. We get off the bus but are not taken for Armenians. We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there'd be a place to hide but the whole road was packed with groups of people all the way from Block 41 to the 8th Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking passports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well. Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways yelling. Death to the Armenians was written on the cars. When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still quiet. We went on upstairs but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call Baku to warn our relatives who were due to arrive on Wednesday not to come. Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors who advised us to come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place and they led us to the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right that's what the Armenians deserve because in Stepanakert allegedly people were being killed 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5 probably a car on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that there weren't any Armenians here and the group set out for the other wing of the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building where I later found out a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri Avakian was killed too. When the crowd left the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait but there was no answer. We decided she had already left. We sat at home. The phone rang and the caller asked to speak with my father. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov from my father's work brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city. To be quite honest Papa didn't want to give him our address but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building they broke down the door and came into the apartment . . . They came straight to our apartment they knew exactly where the Armenians were. They came into our place. We tried to resist but there was nothing we could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He read the surname Danielian turned the page read Armenian and that alone was enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard where they would have done with us. Another standing next to him pushed some of the keys on the piano and said your death has tolled. They had knives and steel truncheons. I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately I didn't use it. I just knew that if I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then one of them commanded that we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken outdoors I went in the middle and my mother was behind me. Someone started to push her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me and fell in behind her. When he tried to push me I hit him and at that moment they began beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless. We are taken out into the courtyard and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they strike me and I'm knocked out; when I come to they beat me again . . . I lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents since I was the first one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are lying next to me. The crowd is gone the only people around are watching from their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up but can't. My left arm is broken. I start toward the drive wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm. We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived but I can't see very far as a result of the blows and it seems that my parents have already been taken away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away and everything will be OK. But they were still there. Later at 8 in the morning as I found out the ambulance picked them up but they were already dead. If they received attention on time it is possible they would still be alive. Later around 12 o'clock on the 29th policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some assistants. They call an ambulance and 20 minutes later it arrives and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku. In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people all of them Armenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events before the 27th. Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was released on the 40th day I found out that my parents were dead. At first they told me that they were in Moscow being treated but later I found out that they were dead. My father's older brother told me. My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My mother born in 1937 was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20 the leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator. They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely. At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov who had called. As it turned out later he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number but didn't know the address. Before the events I had never seen him but had often spoken with him on the phone when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He denies that I was the one who answered the phone saying that my father answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone saying that he called from home which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of automobiles. As I later found out earlier he had been convicted but had never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure. My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar and was two years old when his family moved to Baku where his elder brothers were to go to school. He was a student at the Naval School but never graduated. He went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku and later moved to Sumgait helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from the village of Dagdagan also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait first in a bookstore and later on a construction site. My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I always loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade because it was their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School and after that the Military School. But later I changed my mind or rather my parents got me to recon- sider saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life long--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it more than anything. He always recollected his youth telling of the School and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it. Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home of my grandfather of my ancestors till the end of my days. While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at their residence in Microdistrict 3 Building 6/2 Apartment 6.] for a long time lost his father [Gabriel] and by some miracle managed to survive. I also learned of Uncle Sasha from Building 5/2 whose daughter was raped . . . Besides them Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too about a year younger than I he went to School No. 14. He was riding with his parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them he was hit and his parents brought him to the hospital and he was in our ward. We even came to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But in the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of others those who had died or who were befallen by misfortune . . . Today Suren Harutunian the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. I was repelled no revolted to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of Armenia. After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku the best solution is to give Karabagh to Armenia return it to Armenia since the people want to live peacefully with the Azerbaijanis but everything has to be right before they can do that. I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches. After a while my strength returned. My older sister Suzanna took me in. I think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due. You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno Karabagh often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia we would move here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much and that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was wrong. Sooner or later mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct a mistake it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies in the hands of our government.

The question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer. I am going to provide one from my own current perspective not a historical one.  Currently as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American my own feeling is that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or Israel than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do. With regard to Jewish Israelis they should have the same rights in Israel as do all other Israelis. |> 2)Why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of |> the inhabitants are not Jews and do not want to be part of Israel? Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews I think you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their supporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is to my knowledge not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens of Israel with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli citizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they find themselves. -- Shai Guday              | Stealth bombers OS Software Engineer    | Thinking Machines Corp. |	the winged ninjas of the skies.

Now try dealing with the rest of what I wrote. What is more the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been efforts aimed at eradicating a race (the Turks) or aimed at carrying out a one-sided feud instead of being a struggle for liberation. From the outset the efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder cruelty and genocide so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian activities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of terror and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element of brute force in these activities increased steadily culminating in mass rebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore when the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis defeat Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area. Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war. However when they returned to their country in 1917 after the Revolution Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum in 1918. During this period Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1] For example let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander of the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan: They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down by Armenians even the trees were cut down and they are like a building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word. As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan: Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells they were locked in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to. Including women and children such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled everything that the people had has been taken away from them and we found them in a destitute situation. At the present time the people are subsisting on some food they obtained impelled by starvation from Russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area.[2] Foreign observers who witnessed the events including Russian Officers who did not desert their lines submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war. What is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the massacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3] At the end of the war the German author Dr. Weiss his Austrian colleague Dr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon Kars Erzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the cruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities but also reveal their goal and true nature.[4] [1] (The Ottoman State the Ministry of War) Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat (Istanbul 1918).

Is this a figment of your imagination? Here is another one: Source: Mitteilungsblatt Berlin December 1939 Nr. 2 and 5-6 Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately forgotten concealed and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi collaboration. A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the magazine which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation is attention-getting. This magazine every issue of which proves the collaboration is historically important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. In Nazi Germany Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain political economic and social rights were thus granted to them. They occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices. The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered Aryan and what befell them.

2,It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting.I recieved a couple of letters toosome has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world.Those who contest this statement present the figures of the World War II.However we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop ittoday is the matter not of the POWER but of the WILL.It seems to be that what we lack is the will. Second point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international community didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event today inspite of all the mightthe international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.Hence indirecltly and possibly unintentionally mankind has sided with the killers.And thisI think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world.

Well Panos Mr. Tamamidis? the way you put it it is only the Turks who bear the responsibility of the things happening today. That is hard to believe for somebody trying to be objective. When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides. What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW1 anyway? Do you think it was your right to be there? I am not saying that conflicts started with that. It is only not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering. It is sad that we (both) still are not trying to compromise. I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey. I thought it was a positive attempt to make the relations better. The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated people. They have never met me but they know! I am bad person because I am from Turkey. Politics is not my business and it is not the business of most of the Turks. When it comes to individuals why the hatred? So that makes me think that there is some kind of brainwashing going on in Greece. After all why would an educated person treat every person from a nation the same way? can you tell me about your history books and things you learn about Greek-Turkish encounters during your schooling. take it easy! -- Tankut Atan tankut@iastate.edu Achtung baby!
2,From Israeline 4/14 Today's MA'ARIV reports that yesterday following Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's meeting with PLO Chief Yasser Arafat and prominent Palestinian Faisal al-Husseini the latter said that in principle the Palestinians have decided to participate in the peace talks. Nonetheless he noted that everything will be decided upon at the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers in Damascus. The newspaper also reports that threatening phone calls were recently made to houses of several of the senior members of the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks. The threats in Arabic demanded that the delegates not go to Washington to sell out the Palestinian people. One caller threatened Should you go you will not find your family alive upon your return. The newspaper states that such phone calls were received as far as is known at the houses of Faisal al-Husseini Hanan Ashrawi and others. ---- Naftaly Stramer 			 | Intergraph Electronics Internet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road Suite A Voice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder CO 80301 Quality is everybody's job and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can.

[1] Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization Resident at Building 17/33B Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan] On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee about 50 yards away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film The Abyss. Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee but they were silent there's no conversation whatsoever and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is we knew it was about Karabagh but what it was exactly what they were talking about if someone gave a speech or not we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well mostly they were young people from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of what they could do to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move over there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone recognized me or if something happened they would take me and not Marina. It got quiet 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. Everyone in the theater was looking at one another Russians Azerbaijanis people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all no one in the auditorium made a sound. They were silent looking at one another and gradually started to leave. Some guy a really fat one says OK we've scared them enough let's leave. They leave slowly pompously. It seemed to me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of anasha or had taken something else because they all looked beastly like they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over as though nothing had happened at all. The film started up again it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure made you happy to be alive. We could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine and it was dark . . . Marina and I were walking home Lenin Street that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed just packed with young people. They were shouting something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially listening because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to make it home or not and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation wasn't running. Incidentally when we came out of the theater we saw police policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors because when they were leaving they had broken the glass the doors there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken but looking as though nothing really big had happened like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident with a slingshot. Well since he looked more or less calm I decided that nothing all that super serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus we live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot not because it was dark but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab but the driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station and he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said well OK . . . So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting Ka-ra-bagh they're not going to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says what should we do? Like the end had come they were going to come kill us that's it . . . Somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though nothing had happened. That was on Saturday. In short the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching but what exactly I couldn't guess. On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma Papa and us three sisters: Lyuda Marina and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine Lyuda Zimogliad came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together we did our apprenticeships together she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked Don't they want Armenians? Well what are they after if they're already in that state? She says no nothing like that it's just a demonstration but it's awful to watch it. Somehow it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The cabs the buses well it's just a nightmare. Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore my mother was having allergy problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor Aunt Vera asked him Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out? Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home and told Mamma. Mamma said Well if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on. But we didn't go see her she's a Russian she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I tell Lyuda Ok look it's time for you to go it's late already I'll see you out. Mamma says You don't need to go it's too late already you can see what the situation in town is. So we decided to stay home. Dinner was ready. Mamma says Let her eat with us then she can go. We sat down at the table. But no one was hungry no one was in the mood we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television and the show In Fairy-Tale Land was coming on. We cleared the table. We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony but I can't see what's going on because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something looking somewhere I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor she's an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting looking at the 5-and 9-story buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them about 20 people with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of the soldiers cannot manage to get away they start stomping on him with their feet everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well they've probably killed that soldier the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not. I become terrified and go home and say Lyuda don't go anywhere stay at our place because if you go out they could kill you or . . .  Then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors are also out on theirs too. Everyone is standing staring. The mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it turns out at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there they could stop them. They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the windows all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't crush each other. They crawl up on trees posts and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey Sargisian from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were shouting Father's name Grisha open the door we've come to kill you! or something like that. I don't remember that I was spaced out kind of. Mamma says Into the bedroom quickly! In the bedroom we have two tall beds part of our dowry; Mamma says Hide there they probably won't come in there they'll ask something say something and leave. She says We'll tell them that we live alone here. I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say that I'll stand together with them I'll talk with them if they come maybe I can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me: I speak Azerbaijani more or less and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister Lyuda I can't remember if I told her anything or not. Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here leave vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them What has happened speak calmly. One of you tell me calmly what has happened. In Azerbaijani they say Get out of the apartment leave. I say OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the apartment. I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway the young guys say There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad! They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts commanding them: Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them? And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa carry him into one room and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start undressing her beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes right there in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went what they did or how much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body and tore my clothes all at the same time I don't even know what I said. The atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among themselves who would go first. Later I remember I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in someone tall I think clean-shaven in an Eskimo dogskin coat balding. He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says Well we're done here. They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs . . . She loses consciousness and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony but they can't get the window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong person anyway . . .

Yeah yeah yeah.  We all suffer.  It's too bad that civilians get killed but I will blame their Arab leaders who put them in positions of danger before I will blame the Israelis.

2,[It looks like Yigal has been busy...] RTw  04/14 2155  JEWISH GROUP SUED FOR PASSING OFFICIAL INFORMATION By Adrian Croft SAN FRANCISCO April 14 Reuter - Nineteen people including the son of former Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Arens sued the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) on Wednesday accusing the Jewish group of disclosing confidential official information about them. Richard Hirschhaut director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit filed in San Francisco County Superior Court. The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them including data from state and federal agencies. The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others including the governments of Israel and South Africa in what it alleges was a a massive spying operation. The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL Bullock and Gerard gathered information. Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday. The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring. The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources. It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2500 per person as well as other unspecified damages. Lawyer Pete McCloskey a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his wife Helen who also had information gathered about her. One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister. Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories. According to court documents released last week Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists. In the documents a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities. No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing. REUTER AC KG CM APn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit Copyright 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved. By CATALINA ORTIZ Associated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network. The ADL a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views according to the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court. None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate crimes or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None of us is violent or criminal in any way said Carol El-Shaieb an education consultant who develops programs on Arab culture. The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens son of former Israel Defense Minister Moshe Arens. The younger Arens a research scientist at the University of Southern California said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite Arens said. The ADL has denied any wrongdoing but couldn't comment on the lawsuit because it hasn't reviewed it said a spokesman at the ADL's New York headquarters. The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups including white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations Arab-Americans Greenpeace the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco public television station KQED. Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit. No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation. The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information not otherwise public from state or federal records. The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to persons and entities who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate. Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut director of the ADL's office in San Francisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock an alleged ADL informant over the past four decades and former police officer Tom Gerard. Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to Bullock. Gerard who has retired from the police force has moved to the Philippines. Bullock's lawyer Richard Breakstone said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it. UPwe 04/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) -- A group of California residents filed suit Wednesday charging the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith with violating their privacy by spying on them for the Israeli and South African governments. The class-action suit filed in San Francisco Superior Court charges the ADL and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information on outspoken opponents of Israeli policies towards the Occupied Territories and South Africa's apartheid policy. The ADL refused to comment on the suit. The suit also took aim at two top local ADL officials and retired San Francicso police officer Tom Gerard claiming they violated privacy guarantees in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws. According to the suit Gerard helped the ADL obtain access to confidential files in law enforcement and government computers. Information from these files were passed to the foreign governments the suit charges. The whole concept of an organized collection of information based on political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is absolutely repugnant said former Rep. Pete McCloskey who is representing the plaintiffs. The ADL's information-gathering network was revealed publicly last week when the San Francisco District Attorney's Office released documents indicating the group had spied on 12000 people and 500 political and ethnic groups for more than 30 years. My understanding is that they (the ADL) consider all activity that is in some sense opposed to Israel or Israeli action to be part of their responsbility to investigate said Arens a research scientist at the University of Southern California. The ADL believes that anyone who is Arab American...or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite. The FBI and the District Attorney's Office have been investigating the operation for four months. The 19 plaintiffs in the case include Arens the son of former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens. In a press release the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged them psychologically and economically and accused the ADL of trying to interfere with their freedom of speech.

Just trying to get this clear so please bear with me.  As far as I can tell you're proposing the following rules of engagement between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel revise this preliminary draft as necessary: 1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time in uniform or out on duty or off.  In practice since any male or female Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military all but young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent no further provocation is required. 2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant Palestineans Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans without positive identification as military personnel clear indication of aggressive intent and a clear field of fire. a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for Palestinean military uniform by posession of exclusively military armament (ie T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft) or self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades AK-47 rifles and RPG launchers do not constitute positive military identification and require closer inspection such as document checks. b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source. As noted above dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to originate from military personnel and thus do not justify armed response. c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive military identification of all personnel in the target area of the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not be proven for all possible targets.  Thus if IAF aircraft are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously civilians (as indicated for instance by the posession of uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones axes and Molotov coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to land and make the necessary checks ground forces should first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire. For ACM purposes a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters is usually sufficient for this purpose but may be repeated if necessary. --- D. C.

Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages count as acts of war or is that only when the Jews do them? January 1948: Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold 1000 men attack Kfar Etzion 14 miles south of Jerusalem after cutting off the supply lines to it. Attacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi. By Mid-March The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from land links with the rest of the Jewish population. The Etzion group of villiages near Hebron had been cut off while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were slaughtered cutting off the villiage. Jerusalem was under seige being cut off from its supply route from Tel Aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side of that road to this day in memoriam).  By this time 1200 Jews had been killed. Of course this isn't war since it's only the Arabs attacking. Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets against Northern israel.

Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events like the string of PLO-run skyjackings in the mid 80's (remember those TWA jokes?) and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline bombings they have committed not to mention bombings on the streets of Israel (It's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any bags or containers whose origins they don't know because they could be bombs) or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah those wonderful mainstream moderates with whom Israel is attempting to negotiate. Let's not forget the fact that more Palestinians are killed by Palestinians than by Israelis.  Ahh yes those charming humanitarian death squads. I've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation (DSee the documentary _Deadly Currents_--very neutral and balanced--seriously)--It was rather inquisition-esque. essentially to prove his loyalty to the cause of whichever group it was that was interogating him he had to turn in someone else or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death- squads love so much--beatings dismemberment acid pouring melted plastic on the face of the 'guilty party' and of course beheading always my favorite.  Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back the execution of a collaborator?  3 photos: 1) one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint. 2) The collaborator on his knees the gun pointed at his temple. 3) The executioner standing on the corpse of the collaborator shouting about how this is what happens to collaborators. Wonderful justice system and lots of regard for Human rights. Remember Black September? Ok so they just tried to take over Jordan big deal. I'm rambling now but are you getting what I'm saying? Amir

The distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these soldiers in the line of duty were killed by the opposition. And resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters). Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the Lebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the only option they see as viable.

But you claim these are villages with civilians and Iraelis claim they are camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one fine if not too bad civilians die right ? I am not so sure. As somebody wrote Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you isn't there at least a slight chance that you (not only and the question is very general no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in southern Lebanon ? Now a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea. How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say if you do not clearly recognize the state of Israel you condone killing israelis anywhere. >Dorin are you aware that the IDF sent helicopters and gun-boats up the >coast of Lebanon the other day and rocketted a Palestinian refugee north of >Beirut. Perhaps I should ask YOU what qualifies a person for murder?: I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe. If it was to kill civilians (I doubt) I certainly DO NOT CONDONE IT.

If you ask me those questions I will have no problem answering (not with a question as you did) : No NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder nothing justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements maybe after eliminating all Israelis jews ? Am I wrong ? Now tell me did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in let's say Tel Aviv ? From what I understand a lot of palestineans cheered. What does it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ? But again I may be wrong and the jewish controlled media distorted the information and I am just an ignorant victim of the media like most of us.

Israelis top leaders in the past and present always come across as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs. The way I see it Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace after almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons: 1) Arab governments are not really representative of their people currently most of their leaders are stupid and/or not independent and/or dictators. 2) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising.

It's not relevant whether I agree with you or not there is some reasonable thought in what you say here an I appreciate your point. However I would make 2 remarks: - you forgot about hate and this is not only at government level. - It's not only 'arab' governments. Now about taugh talk and arrogance we are adults aren't we ? Do you listen to tough talk of american politicians ? or switch  the channel ? I would rather be 'intimidated' by some dummy 'talking tough' then by a bomb ready to blow under my seat in B747. Dorin

2,There have been a number of articles on the PBS frontline program about Iranian bomb. Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects. One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include: 1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not succeeded in this. They however have indirectly created the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter. 2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and outlaw state. 3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and perhaps intensify. Why this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have been behind this. These include: 1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of democracy and freedom. Also the obvious support of Algerian military coup against the democratically elected Algerian Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth. A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems. 2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil sources from this region. 3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of Soveit Union. The recent PR campaign against Iran however seems to be directed from Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran . --jamshid

2,In article <1993Apr13.141518.13900@thunder.mcrcim.mcgill.edu> hasan@McRCIM.McGill.EDU  writes: CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES (published book) you'll find accounts of the massacres there including Deir Yassen though with the numbers of massacred men children and women are greatly minimized. As per request of Hasan: From _The Revolt_ by Menachem Begin Dell Publishing NY 1977: [pp. 225-227] Apart from the military aspect there is a moral aspect to the story of Dir Yassin. At that village whose name was publicized throughout the world both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda disseminated throughout the world deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties. The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us in accordance with the accepted custom of war to apply reprisals. I am convinced too that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2]. In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah whom Mr. Ben Gurion at a moment of great political emotion called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise ruler' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey replied with feudal superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.' The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. Kolonia village which had previously repulsed every attack of the Haganah was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main road; and their fall together with the capture of Kastel by the Haganah made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the rest of the country too the Arabs began to flee in terror even before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir Yassin but what was invented about Dir Yassin helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the conquest of Haifa. [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_ pp.226-7.) To counteract the loss of Dir yassin a village of strategic importance Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials fearing the Irgun men as political rivals seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of evil however good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world. [2] In reference to denunciation of Dir Yassin by fellow Jews.

As usual the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes through this newsgroup.  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who is venting his spleen and you portray it as if this is going to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's suggestion was.  Do do not mention whether he was refering to terrorists caught in the act which could be a clear cut case of self-defence.  Would you care to elaborate on this or was this all you wanted to say on the matter.  Why don't you give up this 'Center for Policy Research' crap and just post your biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name? >Ha'aretz 16 March1993: > >Today a private security firm and units from the IDF Southern >Command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the Gaza >strip as an additional stage in the upgrading of security >measures in the Strip. > >The gates will aid in the searching of [non-Jewish] Gaza residents >as they leave for work in Israel.

A laudable precaution. Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray Israel as negatively as you can.  Deliberate omissions are an integral part of the shtick.  And it's not only the incidents that you do not mention but even the stories you do post are fraught with omissions which change the entire meaning.  The absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias. In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light you have accomplished nothing except to prove that a respectable sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude against Israel and the need to vent it.  You This 'Center for Policy Research' stuff is nonsense.

As usual the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes through this newsgroup.  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who is venting his spleen and you portray it as if this is going to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's suggestion was.  Do do not mention whether he was refering to terrorists caught in the act which could be a clear cut case of self-defence.  Would you care to elaborate on this or was this all you wanted to say on the matter.  Why don't you give up this 'Center for Policy Research' crap and just post your biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name? >Ha'aretz 16 March1993: > >Today a private security firm and units from the IDF Southern >Command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the Gaza >strip as an additional stage in the upgrading of security >measures in the Strip. > >The gates will aid in the searching of [non-Jewish] Gaza residents >as they leave for work in Israel.

A laudable precaution. Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray Israel as negatively as you can.  Deliberate omissions are an integral part of the shtick.  And it's not only the incidents that you do not mention but even the stories you do post are fraught with omissions which change the entire meaning.  The absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias. In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light you have accomplished nothing except to prove that a respectable sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude against Israel and the need to vent it. This 'Center for Policy Research' stuff is nonsense.

2,David posts a good translation of a post by Suat Kinikliouglu: [most of the original post elided] [KK] ***** VATAN SEVGISI RUHLARI KIRDEN KURTARAN EN KUVVETLI RUZGARDIR ***** In translation as a public service: [most of the translation elided] ***** THE LOVE OF THE FATHERLAND IS THE STRONGEST OF ALL WINDS CLEANSING FILTH OFF SOULS ***** I think this part of the translation is questionable. Although I think the original quote is plain silly you made it sound as if it is coming from a neo-nazi youth. For example Turks talk of a motherland not a Germanic fatherland. Why filth instead of dirt? The indeterminacy of translation is a well-known problem [1] so one may have to fudge but with some care of course. Is the following an equally valid translation? The love of one's country is the strongest wind to cleanse one's soul. See my point? Nevertheless I think you translate well. oz --- [1] Willard Van Orman Quine Word and Object MIT Press Cambridge Mass 1960

That **change** was brought about by Israeli action; the PLO would *never* have been ejected by Lebanese Arab state or UN actions. > >Please Tim don't fall into the trap of treating Lebanese and Palestinians >as all part of the same group.

So it's okay to use civilians for cover if you're attacking soldiers in your country.  (Of course many of those attacking claim that they aren't Lebanese so it's not their country.) Got it.  I think.  Hmm.  This is confusing. Could you perhaps repeat your rules explaining exactly when it is permissible to use civilians as shields?  Also please explain under what conditions it is permissible for soldiers to defend themselves. Also please explain the particular rules that make it okay for terrorists to launch missiles from Lebanon against Israeli civilians but not okay for the Israelis to try to defend themselves against those missiles. -- Alan H.

At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and tough through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly through alders on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals several calves and a lamb. p. 361 (fourth paragraph). Corpses came next the first a pretty child with straight black hair large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet had gone through her back I judged for blood around was scant. Between the breasts one clot too small for a bullet wound crusted her homespun dress. The next was a boy of ten or less in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the pewter bowl he'd carried now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed just below his neck into the spine. There were grownups too I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead.

Well does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920 the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government ordered incited assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race religion and national origin? As in the past in Turkiye and today in Azerbaijan for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan which renders the Armenian claims preposterous even lunatic. And we still demand: 1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government as the heirs of the Armenian dictatorship recognize the Turkish Genocide; 2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people; 3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide; 4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure. The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Now what would you do? Source: 'The Sunday Times' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly written by Thomas Goltz from Agdam Azerbaijan.) ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES. The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh. Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more than 450  Azeris many of  them women and  children who were  fleeing an attack  on their  town. Hundreds  possibly thousands  were missing  and feared dead. The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened: That's when the real  slaughter began said  Azer Hajiev  one of three  soldiers to survive. The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.  They were shooting shooting shooting echoed Rasia Aslanova who arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through Armenian lines. She said her husband Kayun and a son-in-law were killed in front of her. Her daughter was still missing. One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off. The survivors  said 2000  others some of  whom had  fled separately were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their wounds or the cold. By late  yesterday 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in Agdam's morgue  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial two  were children and  three were women one shot through the chest at point blank range. Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they had 140 patients who escaped slaughter most with bullet injuries or deep stab wounds. Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city which  has a  population  of 150000  destroying  several buildings  and killing one person.

All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women children and elderly people of Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920. It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II and that even today criminal/Nazi members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate racism hatred violence and terrorism among peoples. And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways: 1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility. 2. x-Soviet Armenia employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide. 3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests. 4. Using all its human financial and governmental resources x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism bribery and other subversive methods non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause be they political governmental and humanitarian. Using all the aforementioned methods the x-Soviet Armenian government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue. Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations in the last decades thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

No Muslim left alive - not a single one. Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman Parliamentary representative for Erzurum Karekin Pastirmaciyan who assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman parliamentarian Hamparsum Boyaciyan led the Armenian guerrilla forces who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname Murad especially ordering that 'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in whatever circumstances you find them. Turkish children also should be killed as they form a danger to the Armenian nation.' (Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914)[1] [1] M. Varandian History of the Dashnaktsutiun p. 85. Another former Member of Parliament Papazyan led the Armenian guerrilla forces that ravaged the areas of Van Bitlis and Mush. In March 1915 the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately in April 11 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt massacring all the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in April 21 1915 thanking it for its services to Russia. The Armenian newspaper Gochnak published in the United States also proudly reported in May 24 1915 that only 1500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.

The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4700000 of whom 940000 (20 percent) were Armenian 1200000 (25 percent) Georgian and 2220000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group 1140000 were Tatars. Paradoxically barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd the administrative center of the province had only 44000 Armenians as compared to 68000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897 however the Armenians had established a scant majority 53 percent in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent or 670000 of the 1120000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic a solid block of 370000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia. (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of Transcaucasia). In 1920 '0' percent Turk. We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead. Ohanus Appressian Men Are Like That p. 202. Source: Stanford J.

In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city of Van whose 33789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan on April 28 1915 Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake. Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves. With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.

Are you people for real? The main legal principles of the Turkish State are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution: The Republic of Turkey is a democratic secular and social State governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public peace national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights; loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk and based on the fundamental tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution. Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms despite the lack of any written Constitution. The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856. Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily they provided the basic elements of a Constitution. The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor while increasing the power of the Parliament and the government. The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the occupation of Istanbul the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the occupying forces. During the Independence War the Turkish Grand National Assembly held their first meeting on April 23 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29 1923 and the new Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945 Turkey adopted a multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been based on the principles of parliamentary democracy human rights national sovereignty division of powers private ownership and secularization. Major Principles of the Constitution The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic within the following principles: - The Turkish Republic is a democratic secular and social state governed by law; - It should be governed to maintain public peace national solidarity justice human rights and the objectives of Ataturk; - The language of the State is Turkish; - Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions. Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation; - Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else; - Executive power is exercised by the President and Council of Ministers; - Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the Turkish nation; - All individuals are equal irrespective of language race religion color sex or political beliefs; - Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution. Structure of the State In accordance with the Constitution the structure of the state is based on the principle of division of power to create a balanced and self-controlled system. The power is divided into legislative power executive power and judicial power balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each other (self-control). A. Legislative Power: The Turkish Grand National Assembly is a parliament with one House elected by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are: - to adopt to amend or to repeal laws; - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers; - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers; - to debate to amend and to approve annual budgets; - to ratify international agreements; - to grant amnesty or pardons. Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age of twenty-one can vote. Elections are supervised by the Supreme Council of Elections which solves all disputes or appeals. In each province the local Board of Election runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among independent judges. B. Executive Power: The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are: - to represent the State and the Country; - to insure the implementation of the Constitution; - to coordinate legislative judicial and executive functions; - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces; - to ratify laws and government decrees. The President is elected by the Grand National Asse

2,WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to the extermination of the Jewish race--went on display Friday at the National Archives. The documents including handwritten notes by Himmler are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the Holocaust is a myth archivists say. The notes give them their authenticity said Robert Wolfe a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  He was supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses he didn't obey his own rules. The documents moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg Austria. Himmler spoke on Oct.4 1943 in Posen Poland to more than 100 German secret police generals.  I also want to talk to you quite frankly on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly and yet we will never speak of it publicly. I mean the clearing out of the Jew the extermination of the Jewish race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.  [Emphasis mine--rje] The German word Himmler uses that is translated as extermination is *Ausrottung*. Wolfe said a more precise translation would be extirpation or tearing up by the roots. In his handwritten notes Himmler used a euphemism Judenevakuierung or evacuation of the Jews.  But archives officials said extermination is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives. Himmler who oversaw Adolf Hitler's final solution of the Jewish question committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945. The National Archives exhibit on display through May 16 is a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here on April 26. The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of Himmler's handwritten notes a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials. ---From p.A10 of Saturday's L.A.

Are you suggesting that we should forget the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920? But most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish people in 1914. 'After all who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?' (Adolf Hitler August 22 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy) The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi p. 213.) I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of what happened in 1914 where a vicious society run by fascist Armenians decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse for wiping out a peace-loving industrious and very intelligent and productive ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our people. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We cannot reverse the events of the past but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

You can dream whatever you wish. We have demands from the Armenians. With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia we would sit down go over all our outstanding issues whether it's land or reparations or recognition whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it. By all means lands and properties were taken away from us and they should be returned to the rightful owners the Turkish and Kurdish people who were there 3000 years long before the Armenians ever showed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man woman and child. Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings was one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes.

In fact by 1942 Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast network of pro-German collaborators that extended over two continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record' November 1 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal the Armenian publication in Germany Hairenik carried statements as follows:[1] Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease and when it becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical operation the flow of blood is a natural thing. Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11 1983 published in the San Francisco Chronicle as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian. ...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum Turkey by Armenian neighbors bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors... Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war on his premise to grant them self government if in return the Armenians would help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

SDPA <91@urartu.UUCP> Yes I stated this and stand by it. SDPA <255@urartu.UUCP> January 28 1982 - Los Angeles Kemal Arikan is slaughtered by two Armenians while driving to work. March 22 1982 - Cambridge Massachusetts Prelude to grisly murder. A gift and import shop belonging to Orhan Gunduz is blown up. Gunduz receives an ultimatum: Either he gives up his honorary position or he will be executed. He refuses. Responsibility is claimed by JCAG and SDPA. May 4 1982 - Cambridge Massachusetts Orhan Gunduz the Turkish honorary consul in Boston would not bow to the Armenian terrorist ultimatum that he give up his title of honorary consul. Now he is attacked and murdered in cold blood. President Reagan orders an all-out manhunt-to no avail. An eye- witness who gave a description of the murderer is shot down.  He survives... but falls silent. One of the most revolting triumphs in the senseless mindless history of Armenian terrorism. Such a murder brings absolutely nothing - except an ego boost for the murderer within the Armenian terrorist underworld which is already wallowing in self-satisfaction. Were you involved in the murder of Sarik Ariyak? December 17 1980 - Sydney Two Nazi Armenians massacre Sarik Ariyak and his bodyguard Engin Sever. JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility. Source: Edward K. Boghosian Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity Meeting The Armenian Reporter May 1 1986 pp. 1 & 18. ATHENS Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties including the ruling PASOK party and a host of political groups both Armenian and non-Armenian joined to voice their solidarity with the Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations at least here in Greece the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world. The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA... Voicing the support of PASOK the ruling party in Greece to the Armenian people was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam Abu-Salim on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later Mr. Abu-Salim answering a question put to him by this writer affirmed that his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. The doors of our camps are always open to Armenian freedom fighters he affirmed. Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party EDIK Center party two wings of the Communist party representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens. More than significant was the large number of messages received by the organizers including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to reveal the realities no matter how bitter or tragic they are to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag Bureau. The message was taken as an indication of the link loose as it may be that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle. The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital known as Neos Kosmos where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

And you tried to hide the whole point.. the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed torturedetc by Armenians..and those quotes given by Serdar Argic exist!! It was the issue wasn't-it? you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a crap..

Your fascist government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915 a major uprising took place in Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished. Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region which included the villages of Siner Simai Gulli-Guzat Ahi Hedenk Sinank Ekind Effard Musson Etek Akcesser. Leaving their wives children and property in these inaccessible spots the Armenians joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan districts in the plain of Mus after which the whole body of 3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished to surround Mus and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell into their hands were derided and disparaged and the Muslims themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus but the large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from occupying the city. The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts. carrying out the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours' distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them. At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar Bekiran and Badikan tribes perpetrating equally horrible atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the neighbourhood as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat. Towards the end of August the Armenians attacked the Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four villages including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori they continued to spread death and destruction among the Muslims and other Christian communities refusing to lay down their arms.

The situation of the southern provinces of Turkey after the signing of the Mudros Armistice is described by Ataturk in his speech: The Armenians in the south armed by foreign troops and encouraged by the protection they enjoyed molested the Mohammedans of their district. They pursued a relentless policy of murder and extinction everywhere. This was responsible for the tragic incident at Maras....the Armenians had completely destroyed an old Mohammedan town like Maras by their artillery and machine-gun fire. They killed thousands of innocent and defenceless women and children. The Armenians were the instigators of the atrocities which were unique in history. Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

2,It is appropriate to add what Himmler said other inferior races and human animals in his speech at Posen and elsewhere: From the speech of Reichsfuehrer-SS Himmler before SS Major-Generals Posen October 4 1943 [Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression Vol. IV p. 559] ------------------------------------------------------------------- One basic principal must be the absolute rule for the SS man: we must be honest decent loyal and comradely to members of our own blood and to nobody else. What happens to a Russian to a Czech does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type we will take if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise it is of no interest to me. Whether 10000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary that is clear. We Germans who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children it is inhuman for it will kill them then I would have to say you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug German soldiers will die and they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood.

Then the others will not do it. Besides provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this kind is out of the question. The women will be brought before the courts without mercy and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. This we must do unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all - we all know that - but we need them. -Danny Keren.

That still doesn't mean we should cheer their deaths.  Policemen are also in the line of fire and their job includes the possibility of getting killed. Should we be happy when they die?

Especially when you consider that Lebanon had claimed to have made progress in the peace talks as well as Israel.  Of course one of the prime obstacles to Israel's complete withdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied to the area as well as the large presence of Syrian forces which have not been asked to withdraw as well. -- Shai Guday              | Stealth bombers OS Software Engineer    | Thinking Machines Corp. |	the winged ninjas of the skies.

This is how the history between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then it has been a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened between the two nations.  Of course it would not be reasonable to argue that the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't going to happen so the best would be to improve the relations between the two countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.

[FARID] To count on Iranian help to supposedly counter Turkish influence will [FARID] be a fatal error on the part of Armenia as long as Armenia in [FARID] violation of international law has Azerbaijani lands in occupation. Armenia is not counting on Iranian help. As far as violations of international laws which international law gives Azerbaijan the right to attack and depopulate the Armenians in Karabakh? [FARID] If Armenian aggression continues in the territory of Azerbaijan not [FARID] only there won't be any aid from Iran to Armenia but also steps will [FARID] be taken to have Armenian army back in Armenia. And who do you speak for? Rafsanjani? [FARID] The Azerbaijanis of Iran will be the guarantors of this policy. As for [FARID] scaring Iranians or Turks from the Russian power experts on present [FARID] and future military potentials of these people would not put much [FARID] stock on the Russain power as the sole power in the region for long!!! Well Farid your supposed experts are not expert! The Russians have had non-stop influence in the Caucasus since the Treaty of Turkmanchay in 1828. Hmm... that makes it 1993-1828 = 165 years! Oh I see the Azeris from Iran are going to force out the Armenians from Karabakh! That will be a real good trick! [FARID] Iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the A bomb [FARID] and a reliable delivery system (refer to recent news releases [FARID] regarding the potential of Iran). So the Azeris from Iran are going to force the Armenians from Karabakh by forcing the Iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these Armenians. [FARID] The moral of the story is that you don't go invading your neighbor's [FARID] home (Azerbaijan) and flash Russia's guns when questioned about it. Oh but it's just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor! You are a damn fool Farid! [FARID] (Marshal Shapashnikov may have to eat his words regarding Turkey in a [FARID] few short years!). So you are going to drop an atomic bomb on Russia as well. [FARID] Peaceful resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is the only [FARID] way to go. Armenia may soon find the fruits of Aggression very bitter [FARID] indeed. And the Armenians will take your peaceful dropping of an atomic bomb as an example of Iranian Azeri benevolence!

Living through those days at the age of 20 and following the internal and external news gives me that knowledge and position.  In 1974 Turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time.  Forget about internal news agencies I haven't heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey. However I heard Adana POW camp.

You don't need to belive me.  Turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history  It has been a respected and continuous member of UN since the inception of UN.  No body ever questioned the UN membership of Turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  Only a short lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the internal Greek loby.  I know what you would say next.  Let me answer it before wasting anytime.  Yes!  UN had a few condemning resolutions against Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem especially after the 1980 coup.  Well US and Israel had a few too.  What can I say? I am sure during Athens Junta duruing 1960-74 Greeks had their own share too. >>closed matter today between Turkish Cypriots/Turks/Greeks/Greek >>Cypriots.

Have you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks mediated by Gali?  There was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating parties.  was there? I heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and International press.  He keeps saying that This was no longer an issue for peace talks.  Also you don't want me fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words (that Argic had posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as a Greek-Cypriot myth.  Seems that there is a different opinions among Greek-Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish custody. [..] >Your claim that the majority of the missing persons were infact killed >in the period between the coup d'eta and the invasion 5 days is simply >not true.  All the cases of missing persons I know and I know quite a >few are cases of people who were  either in the reserve forces and were lost >somewhere in the battlefield or were civilians who were taken prisoners >in their villages by the turkish army. I am not claiming anything.  I just told you what was given to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish Goverment/Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between July 15 and the final cease-fire in late August 1974.  This answer seems to satisfy the international community the UN and the Vasilu Goverment (since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks).  Also I am not aware of any UN condemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek-Cypriot.  Are you?

2,I will try to answer some of Dorin's questions even though they were not addressed to me specifically but I feel that I am a bit concerned by the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is often on the receiving end of Israel's bombs. In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth. It seems to me Dorin that you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation. I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of what the situation really is in South Lebanon.

You claim that israelis shell the villages with the |> 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one fine if not too bad |> civilians die right ? I am not so sure. I am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information we are PEOPLE not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business some work in the fields some own small shops others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to imagine ????  It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc..... SOME young men usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist  hideout where an 8 year old girl just happened to be. We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics and we figure that this is the Israeli way of telling us that if you're gonna hurt our soldiers you're gonna pay the price.  We accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers. Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw. The people of South Lebanon are occupied or shelled by Israel on a regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that the so called Security Zone is necessary for the protection of Northern Israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel so the best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border. I have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled. This is the only realistic solution it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in. If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called Security Zone before the conclusion of the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives advance peace efforts give Israel a great moral lift better Israel's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions. Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it. There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon. |> If you ask me those questions I will have no problem answering (not with a |> question as you did) : No NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder nothing |> justifies murder.

Tough talk is done by both sides. When an arab leader is menacing to throw all jews in the water is also tough talk I think. And killing people is mildly agressive (justified in your opinion if they are israeli soldiers justified in others' opinion if they are jews not justified at all in others opinion).

And replace them with what?  If Israel is to withdraw its control of any territory there must be two prerequsites.  One is that it leads to a reduction in deaths.  The second is that it should not weaken Israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks. Leaving Gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages arabs to think they can get what they want by killing Jews.  The only way Israel should pull out of Gaza is at the end of negotiations. These negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with security guarantees for both sides.

2,With regards to my condemnation of Marc's ridiculous attacks on the American Department of Justice and further attacks on Jews to anyone who took offense to my calling Marc stupid I apologize for pointing out the obvious.  It was a waste of the Net's time.  I hope though that most American citizens have the basic knowlege of the structure of American government to understand the relationship between the Justice Department as a part of the Executive Branch and the Courts which are of the Judicial Branch.

This a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups: to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search. Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way. Are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover Israel should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives? >If Israel insists that >the so called Security Zone is necessary for the protection of >Northern Israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation >with the blood of its soldiers. Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of demilitarized or buffer zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to do it themselves. >If Israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from OUR land. What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some guaratees) there is no way Israel is going to accept their word- not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti-Israel guerillas in-residence. > >I have written before on this very newsgroup that the only >real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace >settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and >peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure >no one on either side of the border is shelled. Good lord Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and '67. Somehow with that limitation on the troops powers I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) guarantees by other parties the UN is worthless to Israel (but perhaps useful as a ruse?). >This is the only realistic solution it is time for Israel to >realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting >its northern cities has failed.

From Israel's perspective concessions gets it NOTHING...except the realization that it has given something up and now *can only hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to take back tangible items (land control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from. Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon. The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state involved 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter secure in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts committed by private groups 3) Israel would prepare for the next round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest trust for the motivations of present-day Arab states)? >There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese >goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such >circumstances > Ah ok...what is different about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic policies towards Israel?

It is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth. I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is not terrorism.  That having been said lets continue. [snip] imagine ????  It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc..... I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are terrorist camps.  There are however some which come very close to serving that purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way prior to the invasion. SOME young men usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist  hideout where an 8 year old girl just happened to be. Some of the villages and yours might well be among them are as you describe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area backed by various organizations with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation while mistakes may be made that is still a far cry from indiscriminate bombing which would have produced major casualties. Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw. Well here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police it and prevent further attacks. This is the only realistic solution it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in. Actually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no longer civilian and now primarily military though. There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon. No the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another Lebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary. I agree only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing CANNOT be qualified as murder no matter what you say. No but it is regretable as is the whole situation. -- Shai Guday              | Stealth bombers OS Software Engineer    | Thinking Machines Corp. |	the winged ninjas of the skies.

We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead. Ohanus Appressian Men Are Like That p. 202. A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history. It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable of such actions but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened. People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse the events of the past but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race.

Now wait there is more. Mark Alan Epstein 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries' Klaus Schwarz Werlag Freiburg (1980). page 19: <<During the fifteenth century when the Ottomans were struggling to reestablish themselves in the Balkans there was considerable turmoil among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the fourteenth are minimized it is easy to understand the attraction which Ottoman life particularly when compared to life in Europe held for the Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the effects of plague late crusades and the general intolerance and persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection of the whole focus of Jewish life which for more than two centuries was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>> page 21: <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two recent arrivals from there who upon seeing the prosperity and freedom of the Ottoman Jews prevailed upon him to write their European coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate. This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant conditions in the Ottoman domains but described as well the ease of travel to Palestine and the holy places an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*) page 41: <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the Ottomans especially in comparison to relations with the Christians of Europe. Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation. Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews''  their sworn enemies and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who regularly reported to the Ottomans. There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda in the early sixteenth century and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some Greek towns...>> page 43: <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently and all parties involved Jews Muslims and Christians were aware of the situation.>> page 46: <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common few common interests and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation rather than enmity. If there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was that between Muslims and Jews neither of whom had much in common with the Orthodox.>> page 46: <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian countries to Ottoman domains.>> page 151: <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would characterize it for years afterward but the liberality of the Ottomans in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines and the protection and the security which the Ottomans offered in comparison to conditions elsewhere leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the Jews recognized their mutual interests...>> page 161: <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is however unmistakably clear that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived. We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>> (*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw: page 32: <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren to the counsel I will give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with in this land you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are not oppressed with heavy taxes and our commerce is free

The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios. Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek army Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. The release of Nikos Sampson a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus committed murder to achieve this goal and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct. THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM 2 Irfan Bey Street Kumsal Area Nicosia Cyprus It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks on 20th December 1963 Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom where they had tried to  hide by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum. AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS The date  is the 24th of  December 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks which  started three days ago has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed... The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism. Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum an  eye witness who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event. On the night of the 24th  of December 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor was standing in the bath with her three children Murat Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying in  Greek You want Taksim eh!  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks who broke  into the bathroom emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan then I fainted. When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet where  in  the doorway  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered. In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying Help help. Is  there no one to save us?  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed. An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded. We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally as we could  walk Mrs. Novber and I went  out into the street hoping to  find help and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik. There we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter. After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus Greeks arrested me at the Airport. All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me. ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days. We  were the  first  Western  reporters there  and  we saw  some terrible sights. In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2 Irfan Bey Sokagi we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner. In the  bathroom looking  like a group  of waxworks  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother. In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head. This we  were told was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence. Today was five days later and still they lay there.

Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people abandoning homes land herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This time the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors. Article by Giorgo Bocca Correspondent of Il Giorno Date: 14 January 1964 DAILY HERALD (London) AN APPALLING SIGHT And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight. Apart from the walls they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in I found a twisted mass of bed springs children's conts and cribs and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs tables and wardrobes. In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios a mile away I counted 16 wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house. DAILY TELEGRAPH (London) GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the Turkish Sector of Nicosia as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios 13 miles away were brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three more bodies including one of a woman were discovered nearby but could not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying I entered the yard of a house which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child a girl about a year old.

They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust' is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during the period of 1914 to 1920 the Armenian Government ordered incited assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage destroyed telephone cables blew up bridges blocked passes set up ambushes attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand and on the other ruthlessly attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages slaughtering the Turkish population indiscriminately women children old and young alike. Innocent Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death or massacred with axes and swords or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below. Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions of Van Kars Sivas Erzurum Bitlis Erzincan Mus Diyarbakir and Maras. The Ottoman Army while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914 Armenians committed widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian Russian American British Ottoman German Austrian and French journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads. The Ottoman Army liberating Trabzon Bayburt Erzincan Erzurum Kars and other regions from the Russians saw that the cities and their villages had been destroyed and burnt people slaughtered massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians which became a black stain for humanity shocked and disgusted even the Russian British German Austrian French and American authorities. Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and cruelties. The inhuman treatment cruelties atrocities genocide by Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish and Kurdish people are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. Even today over seventy-five years later the terrifying screams of the victims of these cruelties can be heard. Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia. Although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs I have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people well but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians however the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. I am now in Erzurum and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as well I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard but there is proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.

2,4/15/93 1242  Turkey sends light weapons as aid to Azerbaijan By SEVA ULMAN ANKARA Turkey (UPI) -- Turkey is arming Azerbaijan with light weapons to help it fight Armenian forces in the struggle for the Nagorno- Karabakh enclave the newspaper Hurriyet said Thursday. Deputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was responding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance. We are giving a positive response to all requests from Azerbaijan within the limits of our capabilities he said. Foreign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature of the aid being sent to Azerbaijan but said they were within the framework of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Hurriyet published in Istanbul said Turkey was sending light weapons to Azerbaijan including rockets rocket launchers and ammunition. Ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a high-ranking Azerbaijani official. Turkey has however ruled out for the second time in one week that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan. Wednesday Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer defeat at the hands of the Armenians. We feel ourselves bound to help Azerbaijan but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that) help may take in the future he said. He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing and the whole world knows about it. Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get militarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be based on street-level excitement he said. There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports based on Armenian sources in Yerevan saying Turkish pilots and other officers were captured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and helicopters. The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border with Armenia but military sources denied reports based on claims by local people that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has occurred the sources said. The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared early this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later positioned themselves outside Fizuli near the Iranian border. -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | How do we explain Turkish troops on S.D.P.A.

So far Israe continues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they leave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction.... and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Tim: There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The first is that of Israel where there is little trust for Arab groups so there is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in exchange for pieces of paper expectations hopes etc. The second is that of the Arab world/Palestinians where there is the demand that these tangible concessions be made by Israel **without** it receiving anything **tangible** back.  Given this the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns for its expected concessions. By tangible is meant something that 1) provides Israel with comparable protection (from the land it is to give up) 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine **will be** accountable and held actively (not just diplomatically) responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens or visitors). In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel was assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel from its territory. Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above how *could* such guarantees be instilled? For example how could such guarantees/controls be added to the Palestinian PISGA proposals? Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go (gives lands back to Arab states no more buffer zone gives full autonomy to Palestinians) ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties could (and *would* if not controlled somehow) EASILY return to the traditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really* ensure that that will not happen. Tim

2,I recently read that during Bill Clinton's campaign he stated that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  According to the article Mr. Clinton reaffirmed this after winning the presidency.  However during recent talks with President Mubarak Secretary of State Christopher stated that the status of Jerusalem will be a final matter of discussion between the parties. Now I don't want to start a big discussion over the status of Jerusalem.  All I want to know is if anyone can authenticate Mr. Clinton's statements with dates places etc. Thank you. Ben.

I can't help but wonder what would happen if all violence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully violence against Arabs would stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be maintained perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved i.e. greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the territories. Of course given the current leadership of Israel your way may work also - but if that leadership changes e.g. to someone with Ariel Sharon's mentality then I would predict a considerable loss of life i.e. no winners. Secondly regarding your comment about the U.S. troops responding to stiff resistance - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S. troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.  The Israelis could not. Just my $.02 worth no offense intended. Respectfully Ben.

2,04/19/1993 0000  Lezghis Astir By NEJLA SAMMAKIA Associated Press Writer GUSSAR Azerbaijan (AP) -- The 600000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have begun clamoring for their own state threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner of the Caucasus. The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh Abkhazia and Ossetia but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former Soviet Union to fight for independence. Lezghis who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared war with Armenia. They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia which were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national borders that had been only lines on a map. A rally of more than 3000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and demand a separate Lezghistan alarmed the Azerbaijani government. Officials in Baku the capital deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia. Visitors to Gussar the center of Lezhgi life found the town quiet soon after the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air. At the Sunday bazaar men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a war they say is not theirs. I have been drafted but I won't go said Shamil Kadimov gold teeth glinting in the sun. Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have nothing to do with Armenia. More than 3000 people have died in the war which centers on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh about 150 miles to the southeast. Malik Kerimov an official in the mayor's office said only 11 of 300 locals drafted in 1992 had served. The police don't force people to go he said. They are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan. All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators but disagreed on how the protest came about. Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was about to draft 1500 men from the Gussar region where 75000 Lezghis live. Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov leader of the Lezhgi underground separatist movement Sadval based in Dagestan. We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders said Kerim Babayev a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval. We hope to reunite peacefully by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis the Russians. In the early 18th century the Lezhgis formed two khanates or sovereignties in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates. By 1812 the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917 they came under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union the 600000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders. About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan. We have to pay customs on all this on cars on wine complained Mais Talibov a small trader. His goods laid out on the ground at the bazaar included brandy stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan. We want our own country he said. We want to be able to move about easily. But Baku won't listen to us. Physically it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other Azerbaijanis. In many villages they live side by side working at the same jobs and intermarrying to some degree. But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language a mixture of Arabic Turkish and Persian with strong guttural vowels. Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest ethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary school classes in their language. Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from Azerbaijan they would set a precedent for other minorities such as the Talish in the south the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern Azerbaijan. -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | How do we explain Turkish troops on S.D.P.A.

2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Ten questions about Israel Ten questions to Israelis ------------------------- I would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to provide accurate answers to the following specific questions. These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me. 1.      Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize Israeli nationality ? And that ID cards which Israeli citizens must carry at all times identify people as Jews or Arabs not as Israelis ? 2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be ? 3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so could you provide any evidence ? 4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ? 5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews? 6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48 to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return while their Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ? 7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister Y. Rabin signed an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948 as is done today in Bosnia-Herzegovina ? 8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as members in kibbutzim? 9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage marriages between Jews and non-Jews ? 10.     Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the site of a muslim cemetery ? Thanks Elias Davidsson Iceland email:   elias@ismennt.is

2,First this man promotes the dissolution of the Jews through an intermarriage process and then says that it will be just a bunch of 'fundamentalist' Jews who will object.  This clown even called for 'buying' the dissolution of the Jewish people. Does this idiot mean to suggest that any Jew who objects to an imibicilic notion like this is fundamentalist?  Or does he simply mean to insult the orthodox by using the word 'fundamentalist?' I am not orthodox.  I am not fundamentalist.  I would desire a genuine peace in the region more than this pinhead  Davidsson can ever understand.  But when he shows his willingness to dismiss an entire culture he proves that the only thing more brain-boggling than his stupidity is his willingness to display his stupidity in this newsgroup. Please take your hatred for the essence of Judaism and shove it up your ass.  Remember to pull your head out first.

You may ask : mistake ? Yes I would say. Why is that the GREEKS DID NOT INVADE CYPRUS ? My response to the shooting down of a Turkish airplane over the Armenian air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the person from your Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan. The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. Agression that has NO MERCY for INOCENT people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG-23's and othe Russian aircraft. At last I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again.

CIS Commander Pulls Troops Out of Karabagh : Elif Kaban a Reuter correspondent in Agdam reported that after a battle on Wednesday Azeris were burying scores of people who died when Armenians overran the town of Khojaly the second-biggest Azeri settlement in the area.

Helen Womack The Independent 2/29/92 Armenian Soldiers Massacre Hundreds of Fleeing Families: The attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending the women and children.  They then turned their guns on the terrified refugees. The few survivors later described what happened: 'That's when the real slaughter began' said Azer Hajiev one of the three soldiers to survive. 'The Armenians just shot and shot. And they came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.'  A 45-year-old man who had been shot in the back  said:' We were walking through the brush. Then they opened up on us and people were falling all around.  My wife fell then my child.

All are the bodies of ordinary people dressed in the poor ugly clorhing of workers. Of the 31 we saw only one policeman and two apparent national volunteers were wearing uniform.  All the rest were civilians including eight women and three small children. Two groups apparently families had fallen together the children cradled in the women's arms.  Several of them including one small girl had terrible head injuries: only her face was left. Survivors have told how they saw Armenians shooting them point blank as they lay on the ground. Anatol Lieven The Times (London) 3/3/92 Karabagh Survivors Flee to Mountains: Geyush Gassanov the deputy mayor of Khocaly said that Armenian troops surrounded the town after 7 pm on Tuesday. They were accompanied by six or seven light tanks and armoured carriers.  'We thought they would just bombard the village as they had in the past and then retreat.  But they attacked and our defence force couldn't do anything against their tanks.' Other survivors described how they had been fired on repeatedly on their way through the mountains to safety.

Humane behavior and tolerance of Turks was a legend even 500 years ago when they accepted tens of thousands of Jews from Spain who were fleeing from the Spanish Inquisition. Again many Jewish families escaping from Nazi Armenians and Hitler's Nazi Germany took refugee in Turkiye during the 1940's. Turkish people have unselfishly given home protection and freedom to the Jews over the centuries including to thousands and thousands of them during the Second World War.

Happy the minority [Jews] which has had no Christian nation to protect it. And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey when they were expelled from Europe especially Spain by Saintly Christians and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up as most Americans have been in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition the condition of the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable. One readily reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate... He also stated that: they [Armenians] traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian invader; that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population. TURKEY AND THE HOLOCAUST An  interview  with  Stanford  J. Shaw  (History)  who  recently completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the Turkish Republic and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution 1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies. Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and European and Turkish Jews? Shaw: Basically I'm  an Ottoman historian but  I'm also Jewish. I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history  and as time went along whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a couple of years  ago when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the 500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated  and I  became motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book The Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians who tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint of the Jews  and the Jewish community and rely  mainly on Jewish sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian  and  I approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of view of Ottoman  society using largely Ottoman  sources. After I finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press  I came  across additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War II. In the completed book I had said that Turkey had done a good deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II but  I did  not actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It was too late to add this new information to the book in press so I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second book Turkey and  the Holocaust which details  how Turkey helped rescue Jews from the Nazis. - How exactly did they do this? The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents the material in three parts first of which deals with the period before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in 1933  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi Germans from universities  hospitals scientific institutes and the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its  universities and it  saw in these Jews  who were being fired from their positions in Germany a good source of new talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews  Turkey arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish universities as  heads of scientific institutes  and as medical personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter a  German political scientist  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in Turkey. After  World War II  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark a major  German Jewish economist came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach who was rescued  from the Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey eventually came to  UCLA where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey. One  such was  Karl  Ebert  who had  been  a leading  theatrical producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to Turkey where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara with the  help of Paul Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first phase when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by Turkey.  Oddly enough  the  German emigres  when  they were  in Turkey did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded themselves more  as Germans than Jews  and they did not  join in the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks they shared the Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust which began in 1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time and especially in France there were  about 20000 Turkish Jews. They had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the Turkish war for  independence after World War I  when Greece was threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews throughout the nineteenth century and the Jews feared what might happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not worth very much to  be a French Jew but that it  was worth a lot to be a Turkish Jew. - How so? Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the end of 1944. During the war  therefore Turkey was in a position to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures and  the actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish citizenship  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were arrested and sent to a  concentration camp the Turkish diplomats would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other officials and say in effect:  These people are Turkish citizens. You  can't do  this  to  them. And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated  the  Turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored. The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey. They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the Middle  East and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship they usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews. The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in Paris  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish consuls took place. The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate  either to  get passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter  so processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime it was a  real emergency because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments because radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of these  former  Turkish Jews  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash or  irregular fellow citizen. The  document said in  effect This person is  a former Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.  The diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish on the  whole they accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this means the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who had relinquished their Turkish citizenship. Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry which wanted to retain the friendship of Turkey  was in favor of accepting these interventions. On the other hand Himmler and Eichmann wanted all Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz before the Turkish consuls could do anything. - Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued? There were about  20000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War II  about 10000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the information in this section of  the book relates to the situation in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are Turkish citizens  and promise  to send them  out of  France the Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory but the  trains were often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern Europe  -   Croatia  Se

Armenians DO REMEMBER of the TURKISH invasion of the Greek island of >CYPRESS WHILE the world simply WATCHED. And the 'Turkish Karabag' is next. As for 'Cyprus' In 1974 Turkiye stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority. The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot officials and their violation of the co-founder status of the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which was openly expansionist stated as 'Enosis' union with Greece. Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960 the Turkish population although smaller legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population. The Greek Cypriots with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their autonomy in a separate republic. Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights liberties and their very lives. Source: 'Cyprus: The Tale Of An Island' A. H. Rizvi p. 42 21-12-1963 Throughout Cyprus Following the Greek Cypriot premeditated onslaught of 21 December 1963 the Turkish Sectors all over Cyprus were completely besieged by Greeks; all telephonic telegraphic and postal communications between these sectors were cut off and the Turkish Cypriot Community's contact with each other and with the outside world was thus prevented. 21-12-63 -- 31-12-63 Turkish Quarter of Nicosia and suburbs Greek Cypriot armed elements broke into hundreds of Turkish homes and fired at the unarmed occupants with automatic weapons killing at random many Turks including women children and elderly persons (51 Turks were killed and 82 wounded). They also carried away as hostages more than 700 Turks including women and children whom they forced to walk bare-footed and in night-dresses across rough fields and river beds. 21-12-63 -- 12-12-64 Throughout Cyprus The Greek Cypriot Administration deprived Turkish Cypriots including Ministers MPs and Turkish members of the Public services of the republic of their right to freedom of movement. In his report No. S/6102 of 12 December 1964 to the Security Council the UN Secretary-General stated in this respect the following: Restrictions on the free movement of civilians have been one of the major features of the situation in Cyprus since the early stages of the disturbances these restrictions have inflicted considerable hardship on the population especially the Turkish Cypriot Community and have kept tension high. 25-9-1964 -- 31-3-1968 Throughout Cyprus Supply of petrol was completely denied to the Turkish sections. Makarios Addresses UN Security Council On 19 July 1974 After being Ousted by the Greek Junta Coup In the beginning I wish to express my sincere thanks to all the members of the Security Council for the great interest they have shown in the critical situation which has been created in Cyprus after the coup organized by the military regime in Greece and carried out by the Greek army officers who were serving in the National Guard and were commanding it. [..] 13-3-1975 On the road travelling to the South to the freedom of the North A Turkish woman was seriously wounded and her four-month old baby was riddled with bullets from an automatic weapon fired by a Greek Cypriot mobile patrol which had ambushed the car in which the mother and her baby were travelling to the Turkish region. The baby died in her mother's arms. This wanton murder of a four-month-old baby which shocked foreign observers as much as the Turkish Community was not committed by irresponsible persons but by members of the Greek Cypriot security forces. According to the mother's statement the Greek police patrol had chased their car and deliberately fired upon it.

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag has meant the destruction of Azeri villages and towns occupation of 10 percent of the territory 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule is said in the document. Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state. It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine food experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from Kelbajar Fizuli and Lachin regions and to render medical aid for the sick and the wounded men.--O-- 60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today during the evacuation from Kelbajar region 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar.

Evacuation helicopters could not land near these villages because of shelling from the Armenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-drop food and medicine to the encircled people. Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to get out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja. Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40000 people. Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0-- ARMENIAN ARMY CONTINUES ATTACK ON FIZULI BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: The region of Fizuli of Azerbaijan situated outside of the territory of Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag has been subjected to heaviest attacks of Armenian army for the fourth day.

There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents food and medical aid. Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought on by the latest aggression of Armenia the leadership of Azerbaijan intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life all over the world for help. Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression of Armenia Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed its anxiety to leadership of Armenia. Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag under CSCE Rafaelli Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan. Leader of press-service informed that tomorrow ambassador of Azerbaijan in Russia Hikmet Haji-zade will conduct a press-conference in Moscow. Detailed information on latest events in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0-- AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis living in Moscow picketed in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. Picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation of Russian units in capture of the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan by Armenians. About 100 people took part in the picket organized by Azerbaijani society Dayag.--0-- PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of Sadval society picketed before the building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow. Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands as if annexed by Azerbaijan. Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow Hikmet Haji-zade classified this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti- azerbaijani action of the Sadval society in Moscow. He also marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in the whole. Society of Lezghins Sadval registered in Moscow in 1990 demands the creation of a Lezghistan state which never existed before on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0-- ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of Fizuli which began in the last twenty-four hours is stopped informs the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan. In the result of undertaken measures 6 tanks and a number of the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army retreated several kilometers. Chairman of the parliament Isa Gambar visited the town of Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national army and local citizens today.--0-- STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan. It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 . Attack of Armenian units which began on March 27 deep in the territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan. Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper) Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of Armenia as an aggressor by the international community is marked in the document. It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict. It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE. The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions against the aggressor.--0-- Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name? Before 1827 before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians drove all the Turks/Muslims out it was a Turkish majority town. Well anyway it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the Nazis. Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously pro-Nazi pro-Russia pro-Soviet Armenia pro-Arab pro-Jewish as well as anti-Jewish anti-Zionist anti-Communist and anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.[1] [1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian) 'Cairo to Damascus' Alfred A. Knopf New York 1951 p. 438. As a dear friend put it the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots) was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II. In 1933 he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization. Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy: The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity. Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.[1] [1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian) The Armenian Displaced Persons in 'Armenian Affairs' Winter 1949-50 p. 19 footnote. Now wait there is more. THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh. The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates. The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2000 dead. The State Prosecuter Aydin Rasulov  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  Hojali Disaster said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence. FranCois Zen  Ruffinen head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali most  of  them  civilians. We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy Mr Zen Ruffinen said. We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead. Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office. Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990. Those  nationalists the  Popular  Front finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia fell to the Armenians. Officially 184 people have so  far been certified as dead being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. This  is just a small percentage of the dead said Rafiq Youssifov the republic's chief forensic scientist. They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours. Of these 184 people 51 were women and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation including ears  noses breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed Mr Rasulov said. Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here six policemen there  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February. There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot. People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return. There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.

All the greeks in Istanbul are being treated just any other Turks. There is no difference among people in Turkey. You look at your own backyard first before talking about human rights in Turkey. What are the rights of Turks in Greece? Nothing. They do not even have basic human rights like right to have property fredom of religion fredom of press fredom of vote elect their community leaders. Government of Greece publicly encourages people to destroy and burn schools religious places houses and farms belong to turkish minority. Then Greek government forces these minorities to go to Turkey without anything with them. You will dream to see Aegean sea as Greek lake but it will never happen.

You're not playing with a full deck are you?  Where would Turkey invade? Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be neighbors would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal? If you belong to the Armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians in Armenia and N-K will be there with the same people you seem to hate as their neighbors for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading inflammatory half-truths. cheers BM

It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh by removing the Armenians! When the president of Azerbaijan Elchibey came to power last year he announced he would be be swimming in Lake Sevan [in Armeniaxn] by July. Well he was wrong! If Elchibey is going to shell the Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam his people will pay the price! If Elchibey is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price! If Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of Kelbajar his people will pay the price. It also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they are next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just look at the situation with the Lezgians. About the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government there are no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can't they make up their minds? Oh I see there are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway this 60 Kurd refugee story as have other stories are simple fabrications sourced in Baku modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border with Iran and the ridiculous story of the intercepting of Armenian military conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by somebody unknown from Armenian into Azeri Turkish submitted by an unnamed special correspondent to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate! [h]       However I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane [h]       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one [h]       that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane [h]       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA. [h] No Henrik these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked. [HE]	Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes [HE]	were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities [HE]	announced that they were going to search these cargo [HE]	planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany. [HE]	5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of [HE]	of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess is it? It was sure not [HE]	humanitarian aid..... Your facts in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey have been either searched re-routed or confiscated. Some American planes were searched others were re-routed others were untouched. Rail shipments were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat was confiscated other shipments were exchanged with crap and dirt then shipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don't have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S. uses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway U.S. planes can fly over Georgia which they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed anything other than a paranoid Turkish military. [HE]	Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about. [HE]	since it's content is announced to be weapons? Well big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan from Turkey yet Demirel and others say no. No wonder you are so confused! [HE]	Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons [HE]	to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan [HE]	it self not the Karabag province.

2,I have found Jewish people very imagentative and creative. Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and Islam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say. It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone religion wars are going to be on the raise. I thought the idea of believing on one God was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe on the same God the God of Ebrahim are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story? How are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them would distroy the whole world? Would God get mad since you have killed his followers you believe on the same God same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga? Man kind needs religion since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state. A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society. The praying keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray but man kind hopes that God will help him when he prays. Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the religious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it or turn it to their own way to make their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his cut too! Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other be good toward each other helps one another respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts that we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad he could choose either one then he will see the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop another religious killing field under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would to come its senses before it is too late? P.S. on the side Do you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created the earth he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God you have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created God through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God they were the chosen ones? Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught him about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran? Makeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad wanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there? I think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up. Look at David Koresh how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale the Jews and the Muslims will have the same ending!!!!!!!! Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things rather than plotting each others distruction.  There is one earth One life and one God. Let's all man kind be good toward each other. God help us all. Peace

Is it true that some arab countries like Saudi Arabia prohibit women from driving cars? 5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim countries are subject to different laws than Muslims? 6.

Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors there was one other espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological Institute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried in camera. I wouldn't exactly call it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate to disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases in camera. > > 5.

Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens residing in the West Bank.

Anyone who was registered (Jew Muslim Christian) could return. You might be confusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the Six Day War.

I am not aware of killings between Jewish tribes in the desert. The point of typical thinking here is that while Arabs STILL TODAY act in the manner you describe like any nomadic people occupying a land killing and plundering each other with regularity others have somehow progressed over time.  It is not surprising then that Arabs often accuse others (infidels) of things that they are quite familiar with: civil rights violations religious discrimination ethnic cleansing land theft torture and murder.  It is precisely this mechanism at work that leads people to say that Jewish tribes were killing each other in the desert even without support for such a ludicrous suggestion. -- Jake Livni  jake@bony1.bony.com           Ten years from now George Bush will American-Occupied New York                   have replaced Jimmy Carter as the My opinions only - employer has no opinions.    standard of a failed President.

I wouldn't bet on it. Arab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home. They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis.  The Israelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan.  The governments of Syria Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly.  However proclaiming public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to even the most brutal Arab tyrants. Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere. You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel but I suspect that many Arabs far removed from the immediate border with Israel (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco) couldn't care less. -- Jake Livni  jake@bony1.bony.com           Ten years from now George Bush will American-Occupied New York                   have replaced Jimmy Carter as the My opinions only - employer has no opinions.    standard of a failed President.

This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact? henrik] At last I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER henrik] OCCUR again. BM] You're not playing with a full deck are you?  Where would Turkey invade? henrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped henrik] into Armenia if SHE could. Why would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash that Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region like economic revival co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words  I'd be happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET rather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't do. BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun? henrik]	   Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many henrik]	   cases HISTORY repeats itself. Even if one buys into your implicit premise the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74.  If there'd been a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the time everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no wish to go into the Cyprus quarrel but I suspect what I've said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved] BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes BM] she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians BM] are attacking Azeri towns. henrik]	   So let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey henrik]	   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !! So what do you think we want?  War death and destruction? henrik]	   I will believe it when I see it. No if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it. henrik]  Now as far as attacking what do you do when you see a GUN pointing henrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)? This kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing. henrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the henrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean henrik]  BURNING people ALIVE ! Now some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive right? BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the BM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes. henrik]	   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are henrik]	   NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY henrik]	   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. Well they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods of asking (not very peaceful I'd say). BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors would it not be better BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal? henrik]	   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the henrik]	   conflict. But until Azeris realize that the Armenians in henrik]	   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion. I don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans. Peace isn't what's happening right now furthermore what's happening right now isn't condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights raving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure there'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side.  If entrenched positions lead to war and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isn't strong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right and we have the bombs so we'll do whatever we want so there...' style of foreign relations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps and give one sided atrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course this being just USENET.  The people in power shouldn't be so childish. BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of BM] their blood and future. henrik]	   Again you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension henrik]	   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH henrik]	   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET. Azeri's would disagree with you on this and the maps I've seen support what they'd be saying.  It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner. BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there with the same people you seem to hate BM] as their neighbors for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for BM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading BM] inflammatory half-truths. henrik]   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutely henrik]   for it. It didn't look it when I read your posting.  It would seem to me that if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness.  Fair? henrik] But in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself henrik] you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of henrik] The Armenian Massacres. You don't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish Massacres.' Yes boys and girls let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were. Let's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger and let's do that so our kids will also be hateful.  Sounds crazy doesn't it?  Don't do it then. BM

2,Ok. My Aykut. what about the busload of Greek turists that was torched and all the the people in the buis died. Happened oh about 5 years ago in Instanbul. What about the Greeks in the islands of Imbros and tenedos they are not allowed to have churches any more instead momama turkey has turned the church into a warehouse I got a picture too. What about the pontian Greeks of Trapezounta and Sampsounta what you now call Trabzon and Sampson they spoke a 2 thousand year alod language are there any left that still speek or were they Islamicised? Before we start another flamefest  and before you start quoting Argic all over again or was it somebody else? please think. I know it is a hard thing to do for somebody not equipped  but try nevertheless. If Turks in Greece were so badly mistreated how come they elected twom not one but two representatives in the Greek government? How come they have free(absolutely free) hospitalization and education? Do the Turks in Turkey have so much?If they do then you have every right to shout untill then you can also move to Greece and enjoy those privileges. But I forget  for you do study in a foreign university some poor shod is tiling the earth with his own sweat. BTW is Aziz Nessin still writing poetry? I'd like to read some of his new stuff. Also who was the guy that wrote On the mountains of Tayros. ? please respond kindly to the last two questions I am interested in finding more books from these two people. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Yeian kai Eytyxeian  | The opinions expressed above are nobody else's but Angelos Karageorgiou | mineMINEMIIINNEMIIINNEEEEaaaarrgghhhh..(*&#$$*((+_$% Live long & Prosper  | NO CARRIER -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- >     Any and all mail sent to me  can and will be used in any manner        < >     whatsoever.

There many people alive today who were born in >a city called Konstantinoupolis. I know it doesn't make sense but since when is 'Napoleon' about sense anyway? Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of certain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even today that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul but by its half a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).' Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam' but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name of Stalingrad too is long gone replaced by Volgagrad. China's Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world. But Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul by the name of 'Cons*.' How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable democracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact for instance that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD and that this predates the discovery of the New World by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later. Shouldn't then half a millennium be considered enough time for 'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the Greek reasoning if there is any? How long can one sit on the laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil of Anatolia. These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years. In fact prior to the Turks' acquisition of it following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD the island of Cyprus belonged invariably to several nations: The Assyrians the Sumerians the Phoenicians the Egyptians the Ottoman Turks of course in that order owned it as their territory. But it has never been the possession of the government of Greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. Moreover Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland but only 40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline. Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony. Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront reality. Again wishful thinking is unproductive only facts count. As for Selanik <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled particularly to Salonica whose Jewish population increased substantially as a result from 28000 in 1876 to 90000 in 1908 more than half the total population though even there increased persecution by local Greeks led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire particularly to the great port of Izmir. Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike the ritual murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912 and 1913 following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War when many of its Jews were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>> <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to practice their religions without hindrance a law was issued in 1923 which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday stimulating a new Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica with the Cambel quarter where most of the remaining Jews lived being burned to the ground. This was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By killing and driving out large numbers of Jews the Greeks left a substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time and starting Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the occupation of Greece starting in 1941. Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence. Istanbul Edirne and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century and particularly during and after the Crimean War combined with the same independence movements in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among its Jews caused thousands of helpless ill and poverty-stricken Muslim refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the Ottoman Empire with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as 800000 Crimean Tatars Circassians and other Muslims from north and east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone as many as 200000 more came during the next twenty years while 474389 refugees entered in 1876- 1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the Empire.>> [47] Robert Mantran 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle' RH no.534 (1980) 391-92; Nehama VII 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2 12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775 10 January 1900 (AIU Archives I-C-41) describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek children in the streets of Salonica.

The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4700000 of whom 940000 (20 percent) were Armenian 1200000 (25 percent) Georgian and 2220000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group 1140000 were Tatars. Paradoxically barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd the administrative center of the province had only 44000 Armenians as compared to 68000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897 however the Armenians had established a scant majority 53 percent in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent or 670000 of the 1120000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic a solid block of 370000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia. (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of Transcaucasia). In 1920 '0' percent Turk. We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead. Ohanus Appressian Men Are Like That p. 202.

Do you have a terminal cold? Karabag is 'Turkish' and will remain 'Turkish'. Here we are almost at the end of the 20th century and a whole community the Azeri Turks of x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag is facing forced assimilation torture and murder on one hand and forced exodus expulsion and genocide on the other all because of their ethnic and religious background. And one should ask herself: is the world community really so powerless? Where are all those human rights advocates? Where are all the decent people? Are we going to let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it? The number of Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savage gangs is increasing. On the one hand they wish to distort the truth and on the other they beg mercy from Turkiye. The Age...Melbourne...6/3/92 By Helen WOMACK  .... Agdam Azerbaijan Thursday The exact number of victims is still unclear  but there can be little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week. Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly  sheltering in  the Azeri border town of Agdam give largely consistent accounts of how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25 February    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the surrounding forests. Yesterday I saw 75  freshly dug graves in one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift hospital in a string of railway carriages. Khojaly an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by Armenians  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov Commander of Police in Agdam  said  only about 500  escaped to his  town.    So where are the rest?.  Some might have  taken prisoner he said or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished some of cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees. One  refugee  Rami Nasiru  described how Khojaly residents at first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict. But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored personnel carriers they realised they could not hope to defend themselves  with  machineguns and grenades  and fled into  the forests. In the small hours the massacre started. Mr.  Nasiru  who believes his wife and two children were taken prisoner   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack Khojaly. It is not my opinion I saw it with my own eyes.

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS... As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw the scattered corpses. Apparently the refugees had been shot down as they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over shown to journalists afterwards showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts of the hills. The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly seized by Armenians last week. A further 4000 are believed to be wounded frozen to death or missing... Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there was a thump against the underside of the aircraft a red flash of tracer ripped past the starboard wing and the helicopter rocked sharply. We swung round and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire. We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round again tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads the helicopter swung round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired repeated blasts. Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh to pick up some of the dead. We had in fact been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window its cannons firing but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on our side. Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission. Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary. The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani official told us that there were now five former Soviet military helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. They have signed contracts to fly for us he said. The helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian pilot but fighting for the Armenians. We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield an heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh a sheer white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four corpses and it was during this and a previous mission that an Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed. Back at the airfield in Agdam we took a look the bodies the civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were covered with blood their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis. They had been shot. What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy our close shave and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN POLITELY DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

'Oh about eight hundred.' He yawned. 'Did you see any Turk officers?' 'No sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.' The lieutenant dozed off then I but in the small hours a voice woke me - Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into laughter quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense of guilt I thought or hoped. For somehow despite my boast of irreligion Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would have been. From daybreak on Armenian villagers poured in from miles around..... The women plundered happily chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels the last scrap of food or cloth and staggered away packing pots saddlebags looms even spinning-wheels. 'Thank you for a lot Dro' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must leave.'...We shook hands the captain said 'A bientot mon camarade.' And for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all doubtless in a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.' p. 354. At morning tea Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics they spoke Russian but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on Moslem villages. p. 358. It will be three hours to take Dro told me. We'd close in on three sides. The men on foot will not shoot but use only the bayonets Merrimanov said jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. That is for morale Dro put in. We must keep the Moslems in terror. Soldiers or civilians? I asked. There is no difference said Dro. All are armed in uniform or not. But the women and children? Will fly with the others as best they may. p. 360. The ridges circled a wide expanse its floors still. Hundreds of feet down the fog held solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that' said Dro pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.' Then 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff the horde - nose to tail bellies taking the spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war even though I heard our Utica brass roar. As I watched from the height it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed dogs barked invisible while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted at first heard faintly. The came a shrill wailing. Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in clump of trees thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks while one twisted a bronze shell-nose loaded and yanked breech-cord firing again and again. Shots wasted I thought when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and tough through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly through alders on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals several calves and a lamb. p. 361 (fourth paragraph). Corpses came next the first a pretty child with straight black hair large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet had gone through her back I judged for blood around was scant. Between the breasts one clot too small for a bullet wound crusted her homespun dress. The next was a boy of ten or less in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the pewter bowl he'd carried now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed just below his neck into the spine. There were grownups too I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead. p. 358. ...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands Turkish troop shifts hidden arms spies - Christian Red or Tartar - coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would break loose if Versailles were to put as threatened the six 'Armenian' vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan... An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. That's bloodshed - just Smyrna over again on a bigger scale.

Until such time as it recognizes that *any* religiously based government is racist exclusionary and simply built on a philosophy of separate but equal second-class treatment of minorities it will continue to be known for its bias. If Jewish nationalism is racism so is Islam; anywhere where people are allotted different rights according to race religion or culture is racist.
2,I flipped on my local Cable Access Channel (a channel where any community member can broadcast whatever they want for about $50 per half hour) and saw a documentary (I use this term loosely) on the conflict in the West Bank. It was apparently made with a hand held camcorder (the quality was terrible and the camera was really jumpy).  The documentary (sic) told the tales of all of the children who died in the war against the Jews as martyrs. It was a regular sob story.  One victimized youth was recounting on how all he really wants to do is to get an education and that the big bad Jews won't let him go to high school.  He admittedly spent 4 years in prison (age 13 to 17) for murdering a Jewish woman but claims that it was for the cause. I have seen this kind of garbage before.  I have a lot of sympathy for the Palestinian cause (as do many Jews) but I think that even many Arabs would be ashamed to call this a documentary! The most suprising part is that the only credits shown at the end was an address for the makers of the film named JEWISH COMM. ON THE MIDDLE EAST. Anybody heard of them?

2,Accounts of Anti-Armenian Human Right Violations in Azerbaijan #010 Prelude to Current Events in Nagorno-Karabakh +-------------------------------------------------------+ |                                                       | | On the way the driver says In fact there aren't any | | Armenians left. 'They burned them all beat them all | | and stabbed them.                                    | |							| +-------------------------------------------------------+ DEPOSITION OF VANYA BAGRATOVICH BAZIAN Born 1940 Foreman Baku Spetsmontazh Administration (UMSMR-1) Resident at Building 36/7 Apartment 9 Block 14 Sumgait [Azerbaijan] During the first days of the events the 27th and the 28th [of February] I was away on a business trip. On the 10th I had got my crew done the paper- work and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan near the Nagorno Karabagh region. After the 14th rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh specifically in Stepanakert an uprising had taken place. They said uprising in Azerbaijani but I don't think it was really an uprising just a demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten even women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations but they live here and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the Armenians had done this the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site. I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true the guys from my crew wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me There's unrest everywhere be careful. Well I had a project going on. I told the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it they said Nothing's going to happen to you we've entrusted the matter to the police we've warned everyone in the district nothing will happen to you. Well in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me he knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and afterward he spent the night with us too. I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me The situation is very tense be careful. We finished the job at the site and I left for Sumgait first thing on the morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me they told me that I shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's business travel documents in the name of Zardali and hid my own. I hid it and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus they sat behind and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out they knew what was happening in Sumgait. I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is closed there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well we tried to get there via private drivers. One man an Azerbaijani said Let's go find some other way to get there. They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to Sumgait. He took us there. But the others had said I wouldn't go if you gave me a thousand rubles. Why? Because they're burning the city and killing the Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left. Well I got hold of myself so I could still stand up. So we squared it away the four of us got in the car and we set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says In fact there aren't any Armenians left. 'They burned them all beat them all and stabbed them. Well I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me How old are you old man? He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet not saying anything maybe it means I'm an Armenian. How old are you? he asks me. I say I'm 47. I'm 47 too but I call you 'old man'. I say It depends on God each person's life in this world is different. I look much older than my years that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was silent too. We're approaching the city I look and see tanks all around and a cordon. Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well he was waving his hand we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with them I start waving my hand too. I realized that this was a sign that meant there were no Armenians with us. I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the street you know and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature shafts and stones . . . And they stopped us . . . Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's not. The Armenians usually . . . For example I'm an Armenian but I speak their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for nut or little nut as pundukh but fundukh is actually correct. The pronunciations are different. Anyone who says pundukh even if they're not Armenian they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says There was a car there with five people inside it he says. They started hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the people out he says they wouldn't let them get out of the car. I only saw the car but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from Baku to Sumgait and back . . . When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy his eyes are gleaming he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. We're Azerbaijani' they tell him 'no Armenians here. He did come up to me when we were pulling our things out and says Maybe you're an Armenian old man? But in Azerbaijani I say You should be ashamed of yourself! And . . . he left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had to . . . the city was on fire but I had to steal my children out of my own home. They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street that's where the Kavkaz store and three large 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I saw that burned automobile there completely burned only metal remained. I couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing remained of them not even any traces. That driver had told me about it and I saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton a metallic carcass. About 30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store. I see a military transport an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it the crowd is. And I hear shots not automatic fire it's true but pistol shots. Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city cordoning off Sumgait. I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by their gait that they're not bandits they're just people walking home. I joined them so in case something happened in case someone came up to us and asked questions either of us would be in a position to answer you see. But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly recognized. I tried to keep at a distance and walked where there were fewer people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2 which is across from our block. I can't get into our block but I walked where there were fewer people so as to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: Comrades the Armenian- Azerbaijani war has begun! The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way and turn off behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every corner and at the middles of the buildings and at the edges. What they were doing I can't say because I couldn't get up close to them I was afraid. But the most important thing was to get away from there to get home and at least find out if my children were alive or not . . .

Do they think that they shall move from it's neigbours when the war is over???? The neighbour around will be there and Armenia must live in harmony with these if they don't want a stone-age country for that's what's will happen Armenia if the wars continues. Look The President of Turkey Turgut Ozal died and  Petrosyan the Armenian Presindent is now in Turkey for the funeral. Is it because he liked him? Sure NOT because Armenia needs it's neighbours and must live with these. But Armenia can't stop this war with continued ordertaking from states like France and USA. With other words if you love your people you must think twice.....

2,It seems to me that many readers of this conference are interested who is behind the Center for Polict Research. I will oblige. My name is Elias Davidsson Icelandic citizen born in Palestine. My mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables' (at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go to Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in Iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from my homeland Palestine because of the same reason (they belonged to the 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem with the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare not Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice period. My work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism and racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices in Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based on a principled position but not as a tactic to deflect criticism from Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal. The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities undertaken under my guidance in different domains and which command the support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal institution and works with minimal funds. Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe. I would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted in a more civilized manner. Calling names is not helpful. Elias Davidsson ICELAND
2,In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion. Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so. However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner legally responsible for their deeds. I cannot accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats. PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that justice is done when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called pragmatism a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can never be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace. It is my conviction that the situation in which a state through the law attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does) is not normal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than Western democracies such as the United States in which Jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency such a Fund would not be needed any more. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their traditions why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that most American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW. I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect Judaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism. Elias
2,April 24th is approaching and Armenians around the world are getting ready to remember the massacres of their family members by the Turkish government between 1915 and 1920. At least 1.5 Million Armenians perished during that period and it is important to note that those who deny that this event ever took place either supported the policy of 1915 to exterminate the Armenians or as we have painfully witnessed in Azerbaijan would like to see it happen again... Thank you for taking the time to read this post. -Helgge

Source: 'The Times' 3 March 1992 MASSACRE UNCOVERED.... By ANATOL LIEVEN More than sixty bodies including those of women and children have been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh confirming claims that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing. Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees. From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their own lines. We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out. They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan flew to Stepanakert to ease their departure. A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the same two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian positions. In all 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another 31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies Zahid Jabarov a survivor of the massacre said he saw up to 200 people shot down at the point we visited and refugees who came by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies we saw were scattered possessions clothing and personnel documents. The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre. All are the bodies of ordinary people dressed in the poor ugly clothing of workers. Of the 31 we saw only one policeman and two apparent national volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS APPARENTLY FAMILIES HAD FALLEN TOGETHER THE CHILDREN CRADLED IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS. SEVERAL OF THEM INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL HAD TERRIBLE HEAD INJURIES: ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT. SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD HOW THEY SAW ARMENIANS SHOOTING THEM POINT BLANK AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND.

The suffering that they are Let us not forget about the genocide of the Azeri people in 'Karabag' and x-Soviet Armenia by the Armenians. Between 1914 and 1920 Armenians committed unheard-of crimes resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism organized massacres poured petrol over babies and burned them raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. And today they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history. AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago writes Hugh Pope. I'm still  wearing the same  clothes I don't have  any others the  51-year-old carpenter  said  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. I was wounded in five places but I am lucky to be alive. Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food without electricity for more than a month and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2000 to  3000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh. At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons  artillery  heavy machine-guns the lot Mr Sadikov said. Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town  down a hill through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side. To escape the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak. None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire Mr Sadikov said. Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died  including  his 67-year-old elder brother. I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat he said pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. We have never got any of the bodies back. The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation Alif  Hajief was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing Mr Sadikov said. Another hero  Elman Memmedov the  mayor of Hojali said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee. The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going Mr Sadikov said. I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock. Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

C'mon you still haven't corrected yourself 'wieneramus'. In April 1942 Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian Paikhar son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku. Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler asking for German support to his Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the creation of an Armenian SS formation in order to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the spirit of the Nazi ideas. He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2] [1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen) p. 106. [2] Enno Meyer A. J. Berkian 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax 900 Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen' (Heinz Holzberg Verlag-Oldenburg 1988) pp. 124 and 129. The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any official position. His views were represented by his men in the respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942. Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after a long conversation asked if he could visit POW camp close to Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not 'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy. As such they were subject to German racism. However Armenians were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August 1933 Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs. [1] Meyer Berkian ibid. pp. 112-113. Need I go on?

In his 65-page confession Salman Demirok a former chief of PKK operations in Hakkari confessed that high-level relations between PKK Greece and Greek Cypriot administration existed. According to Demirok Greek Cypriot administration not only gives shelter to PKK guerillas but also supplies them with food and weapons at the temporary camps set up in its territory. Demirok disclosed that PKK has three safe houses in South Cyprus used by terrorists such as Ferhat. In the camps he added terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from the Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so that they can travel from one region to another without being confronted by legal obstacles. Demirok's account was confirmed by another PKK defector Fatih Tan who gave himself over to police in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK. Tan explained that the terrorists went through a training in camps in South Cyprus sometimes for a period of 12 weeks or more.

Abu Nidal's Advisers Reportedly Training PKK & ASALA Militants in Cyprus Nicosia Ankara  Tel Aviv. The Israeli  secret service Mossad  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant information in connection  with the camps set  up in the Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of militants of the PKK and ASALA {Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation  of Armenia}. According to  sources close to Mossad about 700 Kurdish Greek Cypriot and Armenian militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps. They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for Libya Lebanon Syria Greece  and Iran after completing their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist groups based  in Syria the PKK  and ASALA organisations moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus  where they would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos mountains. Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement which is known as the MNA has opened liaison offices in Nicosia Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile the  leader of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine George  Habash is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out by  the  PKK &  ASALA which  he  described  as extreme racist  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist.  Reliable sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking were exposed.

I was opposed to intervention in Somalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there is no security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the lives of American servicemen and there are too many crises in the world for us to take on all of them.  In the case of Bosnia the risks are obviously much greater and there are other countries in a much better position and with far better reasons to take action than the US. >The whole point is that Somalia _is_ a third world country and we were more >willing to send troops there than to Bosnia--exactly the _opposite_ of what >the fixation on European countries theory would predict.  (Similarly the >desire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite >of what that theory predicts.) You continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to intervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this word btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related which is not the same as racist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I said the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result of it being 1) closer to home 2) happening to people we can identify with and 3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which side would be preferred which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the conflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despite the fact we intervened in Somalia the level of attention devoted to there was considerably less than what is devoted to Bosnia if the newspapers and tv news I see are any guide.

If you will stop and think about it you will realize that these people have never forgotten a single slight or injury they have imbibed hatred with their mother's milk.

At the end of that week bring in the Tomahawk firing ships and destroy Belgrade as they destroyed the Bosnian cities.

That is your opinion and the opinion of the Israeli government. I agree peace guarantees would be better for all but I am addressing the problem as it stands now.

That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the Israeli gov'ts.  If Israel does withdraw and such an act (Hizbolllah attacking Israel) would be akin to political and moral suicide.

I agree with Shai  there are many references to Israeli plans on the Litani river but I have yet to find hard evidence.  I had mentioned before that there is a report commissioned by the UN to study the Litani river it is still in draft form.  The Israeli gov't also commissioned a study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe. The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon flows Southward then West across South Lebanon and discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre. There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani that start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river. The most mentioned plan was one that would divert water from the Litani into these then the water would flow naturally into the Lac De Houle.  BUT there is no evidence of any diversion structure (which would need to be at least 3 km long).  The area is mountainous inaccessible and occupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent reports of the existence of any diversion structure there. Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells. It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wells tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the Israeli side of the border.  If such wells are indeed under use they would be costly to operate (high energy costs) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral negociations on regional issues.  The fact that we have been at war all this time has led to the current state of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is completely unregulated.

The village I described was actually the closest I could come to describing mine.  I agree there may be other villages where the civilian population has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and thus gets bombed more often.  In such villages often the only remaining inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go. But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like mine.  One where civilians and guerillas live together.  They are often inhabiting the same house.  Many families are large some have members of the families involved in Hizollah most others are not.  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon Israel is not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines but a guerilla tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with the local populace.  Not because they are evil cowards that use women and children as shields but because that is the only way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army. |> Some of the villages and yours might well be among them are as you |> describe.

Sometimes Israel chooses its targets carefully.  At other times it just sends its pilots on sorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the attackers came from that specific village but has no further intelligence.  On several occasions Israel retalliated against civilian refugee camps even in North Lebanon just to show that it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked. Most of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and indiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side. I have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions this is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than Israeli troops. | |> Well here we disagree.

The blast is believed to be the work of a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas exploded between two parked buses one belonging to the IDF and the other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement. An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may have been the one who set off the bomb.

While I applaud investing of money in Yehuda Shomron v'Chevel-Azza in order to create jobs for their residents I find it deplorable that this has never been an active policy of any Israeli administration since 1967 *with regard to their Jewish residents*. Past governments found funds to subsidize cheap (read: affordable) housing and the requisite infrastructure but where was the investment for creating industry (which would have generated income *and* jobs)? After 26 years Yehuda and Shomron remain barren bereft of even middle-sized industries and the Jewish settlements are sterile bedroom communities havens for (in the main) Israelis (both secular *and* religious) who work in Tel-Aviv or Jerusalem but cannot afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs. There's an old saying: bli giboosh ayn kivoosh -- just living there wasn't enough we had to *really* settle it. But instead we settled for Potemkin villages and now we are paying the price (and doing for others what we should have done for ourselves). -- Yonatan B.

And my son says Those aren't women Mamma those are bad women. Well we didn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid I simply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony and my Azerbaijani neighbor is on the other balcony and I say Khalida what's going on what happened? She says Emma I don't know I don't know I don't know what happened. Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks each second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their heads as they walk and the one who's out front like a leader he has a white stick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft but what I saw was white I don't know. My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say Oh dear I'm frightened they're going to kill us I bet. And he says What are you afraid of they're just children. I say Everything that happens comes from children. There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and Vocational School. Don't fear he said it's nothing nothing all that bad. He didn't eat he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh near Askeran. When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all I kept walking here and there and I said They're going to kill us the Azerbaijanis are going to kill us. And he says Don't be afraid. Then we heard--from the central square there are women shouting near near the stage well they're shouting different things and you couldn't hear every well. I say You speak Azerbaijani well listen to what they're saying. He says Close the window and go to bed there s nothing happening there. He listened a bit and then closed the window and went to bed and told us Come on go to sleep it's nothing. Sleep what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window until two in the morning watching. Well he's sick and all of this was affecting him. I say Igor you go to bed I'm going to go to bed in a minute too. He went and I sat at the window until three and then went to bed. Things had calmed down slightly. The 28th Sunday was my day off. My husband got up and said Come on Emma get up. I say Today's my day off let me rest. He says Aren't you going to make me some tea? Well I felt startled and got up and said Where are you going? He says I'm going out I have to. I say Can you really go outside on a day like today? Don't go out for God's sake. You never listen to me I know and you're not going to listen to me now but at least don't take the car out of the garage go without the car. And he says Come on close the door! And then on the staircase he muttered something I couldn't make it out he probably said coward or something. I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up around the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after- noon but at the bus station my neighbor told me cars were burning. I said Khalida was it our car? She says No no Emma don't be afraid they were government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited it was four o'clock five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I said Oh they've killed Shagen! Tires are burning in town there's black smoke in town and I'm afraid I'm standing on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten o'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten o'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore and from upstairs from the second floor everything is being thrown outside. I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other and I don't want him to see this and he as it turns out doesn't want me to see it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. Mamma he says look what they're doing over there! They were burning everything and there were police standing there 10 or 15 of them maybe twenty policemen standing on the side and the crowd is on the other side and two or three people are throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony is shouting What are you standing there for burn it! When they threw the television wow it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out on her balcony and shouted Why are you doing that why are you burning those things those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their home. Why are you burning them? And from the courtyard they yell at her Go inside go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in your building or not? They meant Armenians but they didn't say Armenians they said of them. She says No no no none! Then she ran downstairs to our place and says Emma Emma you have to leave! I say They've killed Shagen anyway what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without Shagen. Let them kill us too! She insists saying Emma get out of here go to Khalida's and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my daughter's apartment that they're off visiting someone. I gave her the key and went to the neighbor's but I couldn't endure it. I say Igor you stay here I'm going to go downstairs and see maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there. Meanwhile they were killing the two brothers Alik and Valery [Albert and Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian] in the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building they're shouting howling and I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived in the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw an Azerbaijani our neighbor a young man about 30 years old. I say Madar Uncle Shagen's gone let's go see maybe he's dead in the garage or near the garage let's at least bring the corpse into the house. He shouts Aunt Emma where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house I'll look for him. I say Something will happen to you too because of me no Madar I'm coming too. Well he wouldn't let me go all the same he says You stay here with us I'm go look. He went and looked and came back and said Aunt Emma there's no one there the garage is closed. Madar went off again and then returned and said Aunt Emma they're already killed Alik and Valery's there . . . wheezing. Madar wanted to go up to him but those scoundrels said Don't go near him or we'll put you next to him. He got scared--he's young--and came back and said I'm going to go call maybe an ambulance will come at least to take Alik maybe he'll live . . .  They grew up together in our courtyard they knew each other well they had always been on good terms. He went to call but not a single telephone worked they had all been shut off. He called and called and called and called--nothing. I went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says Two police cars drove up over there their headlights are on but they're not touching them they are still lying where they were they're still lying there . . . We watched out the window until four o'clock and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't take my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed and at six o'clock in the morning I got up and said Igor you stay here at home don't go out don't go anywhere I'm going to look I have to find Papa dead or alive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work. At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another doctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say Doctor is Shagen there? He says What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?! I wanted to go in but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there they said. Well they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They said Shagen's not here he's alive somewhere he'll come back. It's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck with three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with them. I say Sara Baji [Sister Sara term of endearment] go look they've probably brought Shagen. I said it shouted it and she went and came back and says No Emma he has tan shoes on it's a younger person. Now Shagen just happened to have tan shoes light tan they were already old. When they said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said Doctor they've brought Shagen in dead. He says Why are you carrying on like that dead dead . . . he's alive. But then he went all the same and when he came back the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They knew one another well Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say Doctor is it Shagen? He says No Emma it's not he it's somebody else entirely. I say Doctor why are you deceiving me I'll find out all the same anyway if not today then tomorrow. And he said . . . I screamed right there in the office. He says Emma go go calm down a little. Another one of our colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen but . . . in hideous condition. They tried to calm me down saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes later another colleague comes in and says Oh poor Emma! When she said it like that there was no hope left. That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured people. At night someone took me home. I said Igor Papa's been killed. On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: I had to bury him somehow do something. I look and see that the hospital is surrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. Hey citizen where are you going? I say I work here and from inside someone shouts Yes yes that's our cook let her in. I went right to the head doctor's office and there is a person from the City Health Department there he used to work with us at the hospital. He says Emma Shagen's been taken to Baku. In the night they took the wounded and the dead all of them to Baku. I say Doctor how will I bury him? He says We're taking care of all that don't you worry we'll do everything we'll tell you about it. Where did you spend the night? I say I was at home. He says What do you mean you were at home?! You were at home alone? I say No Igor was there too. He says You can't stay home we're getting an ambulance right now wait just one second the head doctor is coming we're arranging an ambulance right now you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor you go and bring Igor here like a patient and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ... His last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli Sadukhov. The ambulance arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a patient they gave us a private room an isolation room. We stayed in the hospital until the 4th. Some police car came and they said Emma let's go. And the women our colleagues then they saw the police car became anxious and said Where are you taking her? I say They're going to kill me too . . .  And the investigator says Why are you saying that we're going to make a positive identification. We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I still can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says Let's go we need to be certain maybe it's not Shagen. And when I saw the caskets lying on top of one another I went out of my mind. I say I can't look no.

I have no particular desire >to post it yet again. > >Brendan. >(normally bdm@cs.anu.edu.au) You apparently think you are some sort of one-man judge and jury who can declare total victory and then sit back and enjoy the applause.  But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few rigged quotations can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir Yassin massacre. You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology. At the most basic level you should know that there is a big difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding quotations that support your preset opinions. If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that many of the sources of your quotations have an axe to grind and therefore you must be very careful about whom you quote.  For example Meir Pa'il whom you cite was indeed a general a scholar and a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of his mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience shows) Pa'il is such a fanatic embittered leftist that much of his anti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy quotation that you can use to attack Israel. Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a scholar when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled. It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight surfacing as an attack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence you will see his indictment to be pure hot air.  And this is the BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning evidence.  Unfortunately for him because his book parades itself as scholarly he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing. The Deir Yassin massacre never took place as the propagandists tell it any more than the Sabra and Shatila massacres. Do you get the feeling people like to blame the Jews for massacres even if they have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews like to do it for reasons of their own. Please don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin massacre stuff with facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version unless you find something serious to contradict it. Vic

It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading. I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second the Sevres treaty was even worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence zones had the capital occupied the economy under Allied control the army di minished to nothing but a police force in short a country in name only. I'd wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the city the Greek forces burned it down so it serves them right. As for being fooled by Allied promises that too is your fault. You did not come to Anatolia just to enforce Sevres but to take part in the plunder  as well. K. Burak Ucer -
2,Yarn of Cargo of Human Bones [1] Copyright 1924 by the New York Times Company Special Cable to The New York Times PARIS Dec 22 -- Marseilles is excited by a weird story of the arrival in that port of a ship flying the British flag and named Zan carrying a mysterious cargo of 400 tons of human bones consigned to manufacturers there. The bones are said to have been loaded at Mudania on the Sea of Marmora and to be the remains of the victims of massacres in Asia Minor. In view of the rumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated. - - - Reference - - - [1] _New York Times_ December 23 1924 page 3 column 2 (bottom) - - - - - - - - - - - - On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an emerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice. In April 1915 the Turkish government began a systematically executed de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The result: 1.5 million murdered 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3000 years of Armenian civilization on those lands. Today the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era to manufacture distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In the face of refutation ad nauseam the Turkish Historical Society and cronies shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy merely demonstrates that in the modern era genocide is an effective state policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the successful genocide of the Armenians. Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians yet... Armenians were removed from every city town and village in the whole of Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as rebels. Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians yet...Turkish population figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey the Armenian homeland. Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority yet...Turkey claims Armenians were a threat. In a final insult to the victims the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of approximately 100000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe. Today the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish population. The Armenians demand recognition reparation return of Armenian land and property lost as a result of this genocide.

2,Mack posted: I know nothing about statistics but what significance does the relatively small population growth rate have where the sampling period is so small (at the end of 1371)? This is not small. A 2.7 per cent annual population growth rate implies a doubling in 69/2.7 \approx 25 years. Can you imagine that? Most people seem not able to and that is why so many deny that this problem exists for me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates but large environmental impact). Iran's high growth rate threatens things like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture deforestation and water table drop. Similar to what is going on in California (this year's rain won't save you in Stanford!). This is probably more to blame than the current government's incompetence for dropping living standards in Iran. -- Gruss Dr Bruce Scott                             The deadliest bullshit is Max-Planck-Institut fuer Plasmaphysik       odorless and transparent bds at spl6n1.aug.ipp-garching.mpg.de                 -- W Gibson

The 27th was a short day at work we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed in a suit and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head and her hair is let down sightly reddish hair a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to 45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there? When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask What's going on? Someone tells me Come listen. Well they were Azerbaijanis I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: Brother Muslims our time has come . . .  and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. New people started coming from various directions five here seven there. And the comments started: Right we should slaughter the Armenians! and There's no need to be afraid all of Moscow is behind us. I even heard that: All Moscow is behind us. Well I watched and listened in and realized that this was no joke. I quietly left and went home. Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh that there were demonstrations there. Well people were saying all kinds of things but I didn't have any idea what was really going on. My wife and son were at home but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku. I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise whistling and shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a demonstration and move slowly. My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting Down with the Armenians! and Death to the Armenians! I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside from the things they were shouting I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors under draft age. My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend but I was kind of uneasy and said No let's stay at home instead. An hour went by or maybe an hour and a half. Well I wasn't keeping track of the time I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov but now on the side with the microdistricts the bazaar and the Rossiya movie theater. I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise an uproar outside and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time there were individual shouts this time they are more focused more aggressive. No I think something's wrong here this isn't any demonstration. They would run stop then walk quickly and make sharp dashes and then run again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one side and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square and heard noise and shouting as though the whole town had turned out. There was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. We don't need perestroika we want to go on living like we have been. Now what did they mean by living like we have been? The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others. Speculation theft and cheating go on all the time. And not just in Azerbaijan everywhere in all the republics but I've never seen it anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan. Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' apartments and drive them out beat them and drive them out. True I didn't hear them say kill them over the microphone I only heard beat them and drive them out. I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one then another are going up onto the stage and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people and I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there but I didn't see any of them try to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage. Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration and I had to protect my family. I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee on Narimanov Street it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there a low truck and it had low wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square not toward the City Party Committee but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the cases from the bed of the truck and on the ground there were many people 15 to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off by two people. Two people one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps maybe about the size of a fist maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. When I passed next to that person he stood with his side to me. There was about a yard and a half between us and two people were standing near him. He has a package in his hand and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun but I've seen a lot of people smoke it I've seen it many times and I know what it is. I strolled around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there. Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling more warlike shouting. I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the street. He's a young guy 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag which had Ermeni oryum written on it in Azerbaijani that means Death to Armenians! That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His family as I said lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on Narimanov Street and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; their apartment was in the far entryway on the fifth floor the door on the left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there and he Rafik I heard got a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word his son was carrying a flag that said Death to Armenians! I was surprised because before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being done not by people from Sumgait but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan. Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her It's OK it'll pass they're young kids they've just gotten all whooped up. Naturally I didn't want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking but I couldn't see where. Well I think here we go the machine's in motion. They weren't handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking and smoking on the spot but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window! So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running no one would stop them now they weren't even trying although I'll say it again the police were there I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't breaking them up they were joking with them they were having a good time. True at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people died So many women were abused and how many abominations there were!--I couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities and if I were to be specific I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of Sumgait I couldn't imagine that such things could take place. When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: Let's go upstairs. We went to our neighbors the Grigorians on the fourth floor. And in the evening when those crowds started going past again I went outside once more. I stopped at The Corner a place called that right next to the bazaar. I look and see a crowd on the run. And there a few yards from the entrance to the bazaar are three respectable-looking men of around say 50 years old. The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd as though it were one person wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three as though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up there was more noise and the glass was flying again. We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor there was really no way to defend yourself there. In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. On the way I saw someone hunched up still. I never found out who it was or what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the bread and on my way back they had gathered around the person who was lying there hunched up sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him. That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

2,WASHINGTON (UPI) -- A senior State Department official on Tuesday ruled out any softening of U.S. attitudes toward Iraq but said relations with Iran's Islamic regime could improve substantially if that government disassociates itself from international terrorism. ``Despite the name-calling and the harsh rhetoric from across the Gulf despite all this we do not take a position of permanent hostility towards the Islamic Republic of Iran'' David Mack deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs said. The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour'' which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab Israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons. Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.'' Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting Gulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high on the agenda of the U.S. administration.'' The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren Christoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere else in the world Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term plan to station troops in the Gulf. Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to pressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.'' ``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect compliance'' Mack told delegates. Copyright 1993 by <UPI/Newsbytes>

2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism Zionism and the Holocaust -------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without anti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti-Semitism namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews. The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942 its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in Europe. When the hopes for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change were dashed other alternatives for improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence. The socialist Bund a mass movement with enormous following had to contend with opposition from a new and small almost insignificant opponent the political Zionists.  In outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe. While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of Europe's workers the Zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a Jewish state. Historically nothing is inevitable all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option tree: every time a certain option is chosen other routes become barred. Because of that choice movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an option was taken by many young Jews it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD) an organisation representing a tiny minority of German Jews was selected by the Nazis as the body to represent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period. From a marginal position the leaders of the Zionist Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political power power based not on representation but from being selected as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish problem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in Germany transformed them from a utopian marginal organisation in Germany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to be considered by German Jews. The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934. Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933 Jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German goods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott. It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull out the campaign would collapse. This problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi party as early as 21.  June 1933 outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race nation and the nature of the 'Jewish problem' and it offered to collaborate with the new regime: The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of Jews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda - such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many ways - is in essence unZionist because Zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build. In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott. The main public act was the signature of the Transfer Agreement with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In essence the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The Zionist organisation was the acting agent through its financial organisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts - 'helping' Jews to leave the country breaking the ring of the boycott exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine and last but not least enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies the Jews. After all they argued the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the Jews come and agree with them. After news of the agreement broke the boycott was doomed. If the Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis and import their goods who could argue for a boycott ? This was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von Mildenstein the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS later followed by Eichmann was invited to travel to Palestine. This he did in early 1933 in the company of a Zionist leader Kurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine he wrote a series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new Jew' of Zionism a Jew Nazis could accept and understand. This little-known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of Nazism between the new regime and the ZVfD a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances even after the nature of the Final Solution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the Holocaust by S. B. Beth-Zvi. In the case of the Kastner episode around which Jim Allen's play PERDITION is based even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end of the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and the African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run with a number of key countries such as Rumania leaving the Axis. A second front was a matter of months away as the western Allies prepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann the master bureaucrat of industrial murder setting up his HZ in occupied Budapest after the German takeover of the country in April 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish leadership and to appoint Zionist Federation members headed by Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did this is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland where its three and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the Polish population the Hungarian Jews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class was mainly Jewish the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed freedom of travel served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in fronline units as officers and soldiers their names were Hungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated ? The task was not easy there were a million Jews in Hungary most of them resident the rest being refugees from other countries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere and were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials. Like elsewhere the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members. Without their help the SS with 19 officers and less than 90 men plus a few hundred Hungarian police could not have collected and controlled a million Jews when they did not even know their whereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions. Eichmann told Joel Brand one of the members of Kastner's committee that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz before he even started the expulsions!  He told them clearly that all these Jews will die 12000 a day unless certain conditions were met. The Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary about their fate (with neutral Rumania where many could escape being in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the Nazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not have been believed when coming from the SS sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership. Thus it is that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their death assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps. To be sure there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to Kastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it was a bargain: allowing 1680 Jews to survive as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million Jews. There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be located not to say murdered without the full collaboration of Kastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews here and there but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz. It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration like say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his strongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs Palgi and Senesh and persuaded them to give themselves up so as not to disrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those Jews. To conclude the role played by Zionists in this period was connected to another role they could and should have played that of alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe. They had the information but politically it was contrary to their priorities. The priorities were and still are quite simple: All that furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed whatever the price. The lives of individuals Jews and non-Jews are secondary. If this process requires dealing with fascists Nazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world so be it.
2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Hebrew labor: racist connotations AVODA IVRIT - HEBREW LABOR --------------------------------- Hebrew labor is a concept which has served the Zionist movement for a long time.  It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew must learn to do physical labor i.e. working the land; 2) The land in this country must pass into Jewish hands i.e. to the same new Jew who has learned to work it. Both aspects of the two-pronged concept of Hebrew labor have racist connotations. On the one hand the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other hand its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood. The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from the occupied territories to the factories orchards and hot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of Hebrew labor to the history books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It has blossomed forth anew however as the government's answer to problems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the closing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of Environment Minister Yossi Sarid I have no tears for those who get rich off of cheap labor. 2) to furnish an answer to the unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives. The Israeli government is considering plans to import labor from the far- East to replace native people Palestinians who work in their own country thus creating conflicting interests between two ethnical communities and ruling over them.
2,Los Angeles Times Tuesday April 13 1993.  P. A1. NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE * INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage by a man who infiltrated political groups By Richard C. Paddock Times staff writer. SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world Roy Bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In reality he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40 years. His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in her Washington D.C. office. For a time Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he obtained privileged personal information on at least 1394 people. And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp new $100 bills. These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz a former Los Angeles-based operative divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League. Officials of the Anti-Defamation League while denying any improper activity have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz. Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory. At times the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments shredded documents hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like Ironsides and Flipper. On one occasion Gurvitz recounts he received a tip that a pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him. Shortly afterward another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him. The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League. Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its contents included passports driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank birth certificates Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies. Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads a black hood apparently for use in interrogations and photos of blindfolded and chained men. Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people including as many as 4500 members of one target group the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee. Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant. The Anti-Defamation League a self-described Jewish defense and civil rights organization acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-Semitic extremist or racist. The ADL's fact-finding division headed by Irwinn Suall in New York enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists. However evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes including the American Civil Liberties Union Earth Island Institute the United Farm Workers Jews for Jesus Mother Jones magazine the Center for Investigative Reporting the Bo Gritz for President Committee the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP. The computer files also included information on several members of Congress including Pelosi House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area. In their statements Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence officer. A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los Angeles Police Department which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined comment. Bullock 58 is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama.  Although he is not Jewish he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party. Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative he told authorities.  In the mid-1970s he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast. To keep his identity secret his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years Bullock said. I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all anti-democratic movements Bullock said.  . . . Officially I'm only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way the league would not be officially connected with me. Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink. I'm one of a kind he told police. In recent years however his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him. In the mid-1980s he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police.  In part because of this investigation he became close friends with Gerard who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division. Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group: Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash and would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock. From a wide range of sources Bullock compiled files on 9876 individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard whose files contained many identical entries kept files on 7011 people. In 1987 Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills. Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli -- and submitted it as his own work. Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence. Bullock said he split about $16000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard telling him at one point I may be gay but I'm a straight arrow. In his interviews with the police and FBI Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law. For example Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy. Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San Francisco office. Bullock seemed proud of his Operation Eavesdrop in which he used a paid informant code-named Scumbag to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group.  For a short time it was wonderful he told police. In Los Angeles ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a fact-finder to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups. Among other things he told San Francisco authorities the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had anti-Israel leanings or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment. Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate group.

In other words they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing. Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or may not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships US warships have I believe become unwelcome in New Zealand which has declared itself a nuclear-free-zone. >The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years >there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to >long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the >crimes of which they were accused ever being made public.

It would've been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail lost to the world as he suggests. Maybe Elvis or JFK somebody.

People have relatives friends and colleagues you know.  Israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown?

2,I understand how israel captured the teritory and feels that it is its right to annex it. I can't fully understand why it has to deal with palestinians much the same way jews were treated before the holocaust (the Final Solution) by Hitler. What I totally don't get is why the U.S. has to subsidize the existance of such a thorough abuser of human rights. Just wondering
2,Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased. What I disagree with is your statement that the U.S. Media is out to ruin Israels reputation. That is rediculous. The U.S. media is the most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe I realize that incidences such as the one described in the letter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to ignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities. What is a shame is that in Austria daily reports of the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt go away. After all look how the Jews are treating other races when they got power. It is unfortunate.

2,I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities aired on Tuesday April 13. For the sake of brevity I'll present them in some separate points. 1- As many other western programs this program was laid on a bed of misinformation throughout the program to maximize the effect of the program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows: - It was alleged that: Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological advancements as anti-Islamic but now things have changed and the proof of change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. ! These are the most ridiculous lies one can make about the objectives of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology in Iran after revolution. -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors while there has never been any proof in this regard and nobody has seen Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons in contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and civilians injured by Iraqi chemical weapons. - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi aggression has been officially announced to be about 117000 and even most radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total of one million dead this program claims that Iran alone has one million dead left from the war. - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that:  It hurts me to see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda. The translator says:  It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly research.! 2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought by Iranians were of countless dual usage while the program tries to undermine their non-military uses without any reference to Iran's big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in near future and its current deficit in electrical power. 3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of Technology as a nuclear research center while even the cameramen of the program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the lives of people it is obvious that they are persuading other countries to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones in scientific and industrial efforts. 4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from Iran's different sites. They say: We are not sure if the places visited by IAEA are the real ones or not ! or  We can not rely on IAEA's reports and observation because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear activities before as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build nuclear weapons! 5- As an extremely personal opinion the most disgusting aspect of the program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs William Triplet in his way of talking as if he was the god talking from the absolute knowledge! I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their country in western media and I hope Iranian authorities continue to their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.

Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous? I'm not aware that the US government considers me dangerous.  In any case that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to things such as: address and phone number vehicle registration and license information photographs etc. > 2. Why does the ADL have an interest in that person ? You should ask the ADL if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence or attempt to influence people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters will be brought out as the court case unfolds since California law entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As my previous posting shows California law entitles people to compensation even in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further dissemination of certain types of private information about them. -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it! arens@isi.edu

At issue was not a trial behind closed doors but arrest trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before and there is reason to believe it still goes on. Read this: From Ma'ariv February 18 (possibly 28) 1992 PUBLICATION BAN The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. By Baruch Me'iri All those involved in this matter politely refused my request one way or another: Look the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case even hint at it I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published. The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest and later on their imprisonment. In Israel of 1993 citizens are imprisoned without us the citizens of this country knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison for security offenses in complete secrecy. In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about the third man being in prison.  But many years have passed since then and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries or in the former Communist countries. But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993. The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law the Constitution and Justice MK David Zucker sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter: During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases after being legally convicted the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner asserts MK Zucker. On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that There is absolutely no question that it is possible and in some cases it is imperative that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public. However one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest and on the name of a person sentenced to prison is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison. Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret wrote Zucker. The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that We as the Civil Rights Union do not know of any cases of security prisoners Citizens of Israel who are imprisoned and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which if it actually exists is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter. The Union is aware says Shiffman of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy. The suspect himself his family his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest and so almost everyone is happy... Attorney Yossi Arnon an official of the Bar claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it. -- Do you find this situation acceptable? Attorney Arnon: Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication silence is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand though not to accept the reasons but as I have noted we at least are aware of his imprisonment. -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court? Attorney Arnon: The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power power which they can misuse. -- And what if there really is a security issue? Attorney Arnon: I am a man of the legal system not a security expert. Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public. Attorney Shiffman on the other hand believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security. A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  Clearly we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication. Nevertheless adds Shtendal the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services but with the court which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt. Nevertheless attorney Shtendal agrees: As a rule clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances. -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it! arens@isi.edu

No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity. Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about anti-trust in the business world. Since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says that while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of investing you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate. They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews. The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic / multi-religious society accepting the jews as neighbours was no different just another religion. Plus they paid fair market value etc... They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist myself but this one is hard to dismiss). >>As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace maybe. >>However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish >>state where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of >>the land.

My experience tells me that every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home in Palestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell (so to speak).

And how >is granting citizenship a facade? Don't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews). Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic cleansing Serbian style and deserve the wrath of the international community or make the best out of a no win condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the 'bad' arabs.

Assuming that they are > using civilians for cover Assuming? Also: come on Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in this (or any) discussion it doesn't help to bring up elements I never addressed *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is right or who is wrong only that civilians ARE being used as cover and that having been placed in between the Israelis and the guerillas they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight. [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that civilians will not be thought of by the other side as combatants. So what do you think is the meaning behind the intention and the effect when an army purposely *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will receive from this cover is more important that the harm that will come to civilians.* This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in the middle of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks etc.) the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians. But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves at greater risk? Absolutely they ask themselves why set ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of view BUT when this cover is used the guerillas should accept some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians. > If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel is it not working?

You see there > is more to the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... > GETTING BACK...GETTING EVEN. It doesn't make sense to shell the > villages. The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli > government for the lives of civilians. I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid thoughtless inhumane AND ineffective. BUT there is no reason that Israel should passive wait until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that taking the fight *to* the enemy will do more to stop attacks. As I said previously Israel spent several decades sitting passively on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The host Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their path. > >|> What?So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states >|> can start all over again?

This is just another selectively applied statement. The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations. That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for the interim period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will follow through the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy. Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? If you do then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't they are VERY reluctant to give up tangible assets (land control of areas) in exchange for words. For this reason they are also concerned about the sorts of guarantees they will have that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached. > >But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways? >If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word >of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the >Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy. Absolutely so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis word in relation to any agreement? NO what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND and one party finally gets HOLD of this land what the other party does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back. >Afterall Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from >areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG. > > Tim you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been > disarmed.

While the major armaments (those allowing people to wage civil wars) have been removed the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent.

Such attacks also continue. > Of course if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon > and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't > make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace. >Furthermore with Hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be possible. There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively disarmed UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory. > >|> Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain >|> control?

The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for land and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position) and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks Tim

2,THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH (Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training videotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions the military arm of Hamas an Islamic Palestinian group. Hamas figures significantly in the Middle East equation. In December Israel deported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to Hamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer version appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine which obtained and translated the tape.) My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished high school then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later I went to work for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have two daughters. The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli] Security Services. Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration. To do so we abduct collaborators intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into collaboration in the first place. In addition to that naturally we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them. We don't execute every collaborator. After all about 70 percent of them are innocent victims tricked or black-mailed into their misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes. If like many collaborators he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once. He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier so we treat him like an Israeli soldier. There's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators. I regard the isqat [the process by which a Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat than it is our religious duty to execute him. A third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed. In the battalions we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators We can't afford to abduct an innocent person because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt then he is executed. In many cases we don't have to make our evidence against collaborators public because everyone knows that they're guilty. But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator and we accuse him people are bound to ask for evidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession. At first every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people even in the last moment of his life by confessing and giving us the information we need. We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them confess after that. Others hold out; in those cases we apply pressure both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts confess as well. Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation. In that case the collaborator had been seen working for the Border Guard since before the intifada and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend who disclosed the information to us. In addition three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this much evidence there was no need to interrogate him. But we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case our principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes. A few weeks ago we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of names still because of our fear of God and of hell we could not mark any of these men except for the one I just mentioned for execution. When we execute a collaborator in public we use a gun. But after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator we can't shoot him -- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaborators are strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator What do you think? How should we execute you? One collaborator told us Strangle me. He hated the sight of blood. ----- Naftaly Stramer 			 | Intergraph Electronics Internet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road Suite A Voice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder CO 80301 Quality is everybody's job and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can.

Madness. ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS. Paper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's paper affiliated with Maariv. Date: 19 February 1993 Journalist: Guy Ehrlich Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan (Cherry) units which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories. Excerpts from the article: A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs things good and bad some of the falsehoods. But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry after a time goes in one way or another insane. A man who said this who will here be called Danny (his full name is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service. But in their souls one can notice something completely different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking. The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness. (...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We called such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays when I come home my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach surf a little calm down and return. The keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance so that I can go there. I they dare talk to me before or whenever I don't want them to talk to me I just grab a chair and smash it instantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home to the car and to the beach. Only there I become normal.(...) (...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails. He shot them down hitting them beautifully exactly as they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire with the effect that the Arab was burning all over just beautifully. I was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail and the third at his chum. It hit him straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off something. Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab blood gushing forth from his body spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All right wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry because I felt I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know what to say. (...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too so as spare it further suffering. I approached took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. Standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like beasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we felt the whole day very badly. (...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in. This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled may be for the rest of his life you feel you got power. You feel Godlike of sorts. (...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ? Why shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits me perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to Bosnia in order to fight there. Transl. by Israel Shahak.
2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: From Israeli press: Nazi methods. /* Written  4:38 pm  Apr 16 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- From Israeli press: Nazi methods. ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS Newspaper: Ha'aretz Date: 14 February1993 Author: Gideon Levi Subject: NAZI methods in Gaza Title: In the neighborhood of Hope among the rubble (Excerpts) Mahmoud Jowara'r stared at me long and sadly: I worked my entire life in order to built that house and this is what is left. Only TV could transmit the full sadness of his face. You say that we teach our children to hate you but what do you expect to happen to a child who sees this ? And once again he wraps himself in a lengthy silence his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in the field of rubble that was once his home. The term 'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of what he accumulated during his entire life only the rubble of a house and shreds of belongings. Once again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursday there was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDF forces employed the new method fired and bombed and shot missiles and placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks I have gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more horrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of houses 17 according to the IDF estimate ten of them completely demolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more brutal. Three weeks ago in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza the residents were still told to remove their valuables from their homes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the handcuffed men inhabitants of the demolished homes were supplied with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to stand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were even allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just gold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus last Thursday some 45 men stood for about 12 hours their hands bound behind their backs their eyes blindfolded without food with wet pants on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their hearts listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their homes one after the other. (...) Dr. Juma'a Fuad Said al-Rubi. the brother from Saudi Arabia emerges from among the ruins. Ten days ago he arrived for a family visit mainly in order to celebrate the housewarming with his father and brothers. On Thursday he was handcuffed like everyone else for 12 hours and later went with everyone to view the destrucion. He tried to explain that he was a visitor and that he is a physician but only got a shove.  Like all the rest he also urinated in his pants while standing with his hands bound and his eyes blindfolded for the entire day. Juma'a al-Rubi studied medicine at Cairo University and for ten years he has been treating wealthy Saudis in Medina. His wife and four children remained there. Now his documents have been lost and he does not know how he will return to them. There is no humanity stated the physician from Saudi Arabia.
2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: From Israeli press. TORTURE. /* Written  4:41 pm  Apr 16 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- From Israeli press. TORTURE. ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS. Newspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz Subject: Torture Title of article: Moderate physical pressure Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation room in Tulkarm prison during which he says he was humiliated beaten and tortured Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator a Shabak agent 'Captain Louis' chatting on the phone with his wife. At those moments Omar said I felt that he was like a humanbeing but right after he finished talking he would be beat me and say 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed yourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being. In late October 1992 after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm prison Omar Jaber was released without charges. Among the Jews as among the Arabs there are good people and bad people he said after his release but there in Tulkarm in the interrogations rooms you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that he is a human being. Although he left the detention installation in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (I sat at home for ten days. My hands shook from nerves) one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He got out not so healthy but entire and even ultimately returned to normal functioning at the small solar heater plant he owns. In contrast Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi for example was released seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the Shabak wing cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak or react. Mustafa Barakat aged only 23 who was arrested in early August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation left it one day later - dead. We have recently received an especially large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators noted Dr. Niv Gordon director of the Association of Israel and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...) The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan Saber Makhlouf a 20 year old student. In fact he was extremely fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated in Tulkarm prison in case the publication in the paper would return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment. (...follow description of tortures....) Omar a tall bearded man was silent. I do not want to talk about it he finally said quietly. Some time later embarrased and ashamed he spoke: Sometimes he beats you and beats you until you'll kiss his hand and not only his hand. Even the hands of another interrogator and another whom he calls into the room and the last interrogator says: Now you are kissing my hand and later if I want you will kiss my ass. These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation located within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West Bank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In early March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories to visit Tulkarm prison but denied them access to the interrogation wing. The interrogation wing is Shabak property being solely under Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by it said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an the commander of the installation according to the internal report written by B'tselem member Yuval Ginbar following the visit. Major David Pe'er governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command was quoted in the report:  There is an ethical problem here - no one can enter the interrogation wing. Transl. by I.

2,I don't know anything about this particular case but *other* governments have been known to follow events on the Usenet.  For example after Tienanmien Square in Beijing the Chinese government began monitoring cyberspace.  As the former Director of PeaceNet I am aware of many incidents of local state national and international authorities monitoring Usenet and other conferences such as those on the Institute for Global Communications.  But what's the big deal?  You shouldn't advocate illegal acts in this medium in any case.  If you are concerned about being monitored you should use encyrption software (available in IGC's micro conference).  I know for a fact that human rights activists in the Balkan-Mideast area use encryption software to send out their reports to international organizations.  Such message *can* be decoded however by large computers consuming much CPU time which probably the Turkish government doesn't have access to.

Ha'aretz 15 March 1993: Yehoshua Matza (Likud) Chair of the Knesset Interior Committee stated that he intends to demand that the police department make it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills [non-Jewish] terrorists will not be put on trial. Ha'aretz 16 March1993: Today a private security firm and units from the IDF Southern Command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the Gaza strip as an additional stage in the upgrading of security measures in the Strip. The gates will aid in the searching of [non-Jewish] Gaza residents as they leave for work in Israel. They can be used to reveal the presence of knives axes weapons and other sharp objects. In addition to the gates which will be operated by a private civilian company large quantities of magnetic-card reading devices are being brought to the inspection points to facilitate the reading of the magnetic cards these [non-Jewish] workers must carry.

2,The comparison of the Palestinian situation with the Holocaust is insulting and completely false.  Any person making such a rude and false comparison is either ignorant of the Holocaust or also ignorant of the situation in the mideast or is an anti-semite. To compare a complicated political situation with the genocide of 6000000 Jews is racist in and of itself.
2,As someone who reads Israeli newpapaers every day I can state with absolute certainty that anybody who relies on western media to get a picture of what is happening in Israel is not getting an accurate picture.  There is tremendous bias in those stories that do get reported.  And the stories that NEVER get mentioned create a completely false picture of the mideast.
2,How many of you readers know anything about Jews living in the Arab countries?  How many of you know if Jews still live in these countries?  How many of you know what the circumstances of Arabic Jews leaving their homelands were?  Just curious.

Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting and racist beyond belief.  The attempts to quiet any violence in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than anti-Israel bigotry. >The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population >density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks. >The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of >Gaza some 700.000 people by denying them the right to leave the >strip and seek work in Israel. It is NOT punishment but protection from repeated attacks by residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to WHY Israel has had to take action.

Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials taking place.  Can you document this or is this more of your stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan residents applied for citizenship HAMAS would murder them as collaborators. Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in >Israel. They may not live there for these areas are reserved for >the Master Race. How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you attack a people when you omit facts which fly in the face of your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have the same bigoted makeup as you? Here's another little fly in your ointment about the 'master race' for you to avoid... Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the responsibility for them they were allowed into Israel.  Yes Israel.  But when the plane landed the Israeli Arabs who had previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved with the rescue project because they felt that it would make Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved them to a kibbutz where they are safe and secure.  The truth is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of the 400 deportees Lebanon was willing to let their so-called Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary in Lebanon. Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait just because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich nations who do nothing for these people is to use the plight of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews or your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare. >The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the >right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the >occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some >Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over >Gaza through Arab collaborators. Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives or had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is to degrade the dead and to show that intelligent debate on a difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf yet it is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it were considered you might actually have to deal with mideast problems in a balanced manner rather than in an anti-semitic manner. >As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible >with basic human rights and international law that of becoming >Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for >self-determination it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish >society does not consider Gazans full human beings. And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it but had taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land Israel captures in wars wars which other nations have ALWAYS started aren't the same as Israel and they are subject to a completely different set of international laws?

You inability to come to terms with what you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order. >I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever >they can to help the Gazans regain their full human civil and >political rights to which they are entitled as human beings. Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran or Iraq or Yemen or Saudi Arabia or Syria?  Do you have an inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved. They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are. And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your life to attacking in the guise of compassion. Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your case it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do some good. But for now you are a fruad.

If so then let me tell you some good jokes: There is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII Palestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and more. In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place. People die that is all. No one gets killed. Maybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all. Maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in there.they may be thought it was like snifing cocaine. No? What do you think of this ? Isn't it stupid to say so? Well it is as stupid as what you said .Next time you want to lie do it intelligently. Sincerely yours. Hassan Arab civilians did die at Dir yassin. But there was no massacre. First of all the village housed many *armed* troops. Secondly the Irgun and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians. The village was attacked only for its military significance. In fact a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before the attack was to begin. By all rational standards Dir Yassin was not a massacre. The killing was unintentional. The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops. Thus it was attacked for its military significance. It was not attacked with intentions of killing any civilians. To even compare Dir Yassin in which some 120 or so Arabs died to the Holocaust is absurd. The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians. The village had almost 1000 inhabitants most of whom survived. Harry.
2,From _Myths and Facts_ by Leonard J. Davis Near East Research Inc. 1989: [pp. 108-109] Unlike the PLO's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets the 100 troups from the Irgun and Stern group that struck at Deir Yassin on April 10 1948 targeted the village for its military importance. Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem which the Arabs had blockaded and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars. Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens in Jerusalem. Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin but that attack does not conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried to paint. The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about 250. In 1983 however Eric Silver of _The Guardian_ (Britain) interviewed a survivor Mophammed Sammour who testified that 116 out of a population of 800-1000 were killed. 'About three days after the massacre' Sammour explained 'representatives of each of the five clans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made a list of the people who had not been found (alive). We went through the names.  Nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figure was wrong.' Unlike the PLO's deliberate attacks on civilians the killing of civilians at Deir Yassin was not premeditated. The attackers left open an escape corridor from the village and more than 200 residents left unharmed. After the remaining Arabs feigned surrender and then fired on the Jewish troops some of the attackers killed Arab soldiers and civilians indiscriminately. Independent observers told _The Guardian_ that among the bodies they found Arab men disguised as women.

[...] Elias should the families of the children who were stabbed in their high school by a Palestinian freedom fighter be the ones who offer their help to the Gazans. Perhaps it should be the families of the 18 Israelis who were murdered last month by Palestinian freedom fighters. The Jews in the Warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves and their families from being sent to Nazi gas chambers. Groups like Hamas and the Islamic Jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving all Jews into the sea. Perhaps we should persuade Jewish people to help these wnderful freedom fighters attain this ultimate goal. Maybe the freedom fighters will choose to spare the co-operative Jews. Is that what you are counting on Elias - the pity of murderers. You say your mother was Jewish. How ashamed she must be of her son. I am sorry Mrs. Davidsson. Harry.

During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the brutality displayed but could not make any effective protest. Some mercifully were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut and then after crowding the hut with Turks set fire to the straw.

2,The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in x-Soviet Armenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today. 69 year old Hatin Nine telling: -''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.'' 72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu: - ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours. While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are Turks you must die.'' 28 year old Gulsum Huseyin: - ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes.'' Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region? The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures of people who were bayonetted whose eyes were gouged ears cut off. Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these lies. They are saying exaggeration. That means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach... The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word. Some of the western press' led by some French Newspapers ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre. Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.'' The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe) and rules all designed to fight against human rights violations. International reactions must be made with international cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized. Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals journalists writers TV stations of certain western countries such as France who are fast to claim leadership of human rights? Where are you?

2,In 1941 while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943 this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20000-strong under the command of Dro (the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination of the Jews. This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encore performance staged by the Armenians during WWI when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.

Pardon me? Greece Government Rail-Roads Two Turkish Ethnic Deputies While World Human Rights Organizations Scream Greeks Persistently Work on Removing the Parliamentary Immunity of Dr. Sadik Ahmet and Mr. Ahmet Faikoglu. Dr. Sadik Ahmet Turkish Ethnic Member of Greek Parliament Visits US Washington DC July 7- Doctor Sadik Ahmet one of the two ethnic Turkish members of the Greek parliament visited US on june 24 through July 5th and held meetings with human rights organizations and high-level US officials in Washington DC and New York. At his press conference at the National Press Club in Washington DC Sadik Ahmet explained the plight of ethnic Turks in Greece and stated six demands from Greek government. Ahmet said our only hope in Greece is the pressure generated from Western capitals for insisting that Greece respects the human rights. What we are having done to ethnic Turks in Greece is exactly the same as South African Apartheid. He added: What we are facing is pure Greek hatred and racial discrimination. Spelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greece he said We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of 544 ethnic Turks. Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this people have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizens and are residing in Greece even one of them is actively serving in the Greek army. Besides other non-Turkish citizens of Greece are not subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of Greek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in the United States. We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights. We want Greek government to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights. Our people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses. The Greek government is not granting building permits to Turks for renovating our buildings or building new ones. If your name is Turkish you are not hired to the government offices. Furthermore we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity in business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the economic life of Greece. In my case they denied me a medical license necessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the fact that I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all the necessary steps in my career. We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks. We are not allowed to call ourselves Turks. I myself have been subject of a number of law suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself a Turk. We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion. In separate interview with The Turkish Times Dr. Sadik Ahmet stated that the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of Greek laws ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example he said there are about 20000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki) and only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do not want to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He said that Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out of the parliament as an independent representative and they stated this fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualification requirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes they imposed this requirement for the independent parties including the Turkish candidates. Ahmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini) Greece 1947. He earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974. he served in the Greek military as an infantryman. In 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time by collecting 15000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation of laws against ethnic Turks. In 1986 he was arrested by the police for collecting signatures.

THE ARMENIAN FOUNDATION PROVIDED 30 BILLION TL TO ASALA 01/09/92 MILLIYET-- The Armenian Foundation based in Istanbul is found to have provided 30 billion Turkish Lira ($6 million) to the Armenian terrorist organization ASALA which have murdered several Turkish diplomats abroad... Experts on international terrorism assert that the Armenian terrorists use proceeds from drug trafficking (and from the Armenian Foundation) to fund their deadly enterprises. The deadliest of terrorist assassins Carlos proclaimed on Spanish television that his organization had entered into a working relationship with Armenian terrorists and they are using drug trafficking to raise money 'to continue' to slaughter innocent people. Now what is your personal and organizational role in this scheme? Recent reports which have been confirmed by the U.S. Administration indicate that Armenian terrorist organizations are collaborating with those who are responsible for the bombing of the United States Marine barracks in Beirut.

If you consider Israeli reporting of events in Israel to be propoganda then consider the Washington Post's handling of American events to be propoganda too.  What makes the Israeli press inherently biased in your opinion?  I wouldn't compare it to Nazi propoganda either.

Not this time Enis. Furthermore a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment politically mature and conscious who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause through all necessary means ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. In other words what we have is a demand from the fascist government of x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our people. The crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination of the Muslim population in the Soviet Republic of Armenia Karabag Bosnia and Herzegovina is an 'Islamic Holocaust' comparable to the extermination of 2.5 million Muslims by the Armenian Government during the WWI and of over 6 million European Jews during the WWII. (Tovfik Kasimov - Azeri Leader - September 25 1992) Today's ethnic cleansing policies by the Serbian dictatorship against Croatians and Muslims of Yugoslavia as well as the Soviet Republic of Armenia's against the Muslim population of neighboring Azerbaijan are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide perpetrated by the Armenian Government 78 years ago against the Turkish and Kurdish Muslims and Sephardic Jews living in these lands.

All that changes is the phrasing; complaining >that I used the wrong word is a quibble. Well your Armenian grandparents were fascist. As early as 1934 K. S. Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians 'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1] At that time he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkish population of eastern Anatolia. However extreme rightwing ideological tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1936 for example O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted in the 'Hairenik Weekly:' The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall see that races due to their innate force have created the nations and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race. On the other hand Russia is comparatively weak because she is bereft of social sanctities.[2] [1] K. S. Papazian 'Patriotism Perverted' (Boston Baikar Press 1934) Preface. [2] 'Hairenik Weekly' Friday April 10 1936 'The Race is our Refuge' by O. Zarmooni.

The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4700000 of whom 940000 (20 percent) were Armenian 1200000 (25 percent) Georgian and 2220000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group 1140000 were Tatars. Paradoxically barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd the administrative center of the province had only 44000 Armenians as compared to 68000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897 however the Armenians had established a scant majority 53 percent in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent or 670000 of the 1120000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic a solid block of 370000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia. (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of Transcaucasia). In 1920 '0' percent Turk. We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead. Ohanus Appressian Men Are Like That p. 202. In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul. It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us create for ourselves. It certainly is possible to severe the artificial life-support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats in this alien land.

No kidding. The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women children and elderly people burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that they are doing it again at a different scale in fascist x-Soviet Armenia today. A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh Azerbaijan is reported to have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its sovereignty.

The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the Turkish Minority in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify themselves as 'Turks'.

In an  interview with the Greek  newspaper Ethnos he said:  I am a Greek  citizen of Turkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western Trace are also Turkish. Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in Western  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.

Because  we prevented Greece the cradle of democracy from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal rights. On Turco-Greek relations he pointed  out that both countries are predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by cooperating adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was will to improve relations with Greece. NEWSPOT January 1993 |3| MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE. Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS. Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine. Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  ENA  on  March  11  1992  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election. Bulev said in the interview: I am not Greek I am Macedonian. Sideropoulos said  in the  article that Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling. The  main  charge  against  the two  according  to  the  court summons  was   that  they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece). The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350000 to 1000000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian. In  1913  Greece   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500000 in Bulgaria; 150000 in Albania; and 300000 in Serbia proper. Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia) where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live. Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour the Republic of Macedonia. Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over.

2,Would it be asking too much for you to DOCUMENT these allegations of Israel used to arrest and kill neutral reporters? I think you confuse Israel with other nations of that geographical region to which the notion of a free unmonitored by the government press corps would be a joke. As for the notion that Israel threatens the human rights of Palestinians by sealing off the Gaza strip get real. When the Palestinian-on-Palestinian civil war stops and all Palestinians can behave like mature human beings Israel will talk concessions on both sides for peace. Not before.

(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith) What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in as far as I can get from the Arab media is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants. However whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture blowing up their homes murders...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice. As for the PLO I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind. Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion.

I agree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased. But I believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli accounts the Americans are biased. I just thought that the Israelis had more motivation for bias. The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its gross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed most such attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often the only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. and Israel). It is also interesting to note that that means other western countries realize these human rights violations. So maybe there are human rights violations going on after all.

2,Aryans who do not base their reasoning on Nazi ideology are racists... Thus spoke an American citizen in the name of Judaism. If this is Judaism I think Judaism should be combatted as any extremist and dangerous philosophy. I suspect however that Martin Buber Albert Einstein and other Jewish scholars would have rather converted to Christianity than stay Jews if they would have perceived Judaism as such a perverted philosophy. Those who wish to learn something about the perversion of Judaism should consult the masterly work by Yehoshua Harkabi who was many years the head of Israeli Intelligence and an opponent of the PLO. His latest book was published in English and includes a very detailed analysis of Judeo-Nazism.

There are a staggering number of victims in the world and more each day.  I think on balance intervention would create more victims including American ones.  Since the first responsibility of the US government is to protect Americans I think they serve that role best by staying away from Bosnia and other regional conflicts. >Would you in WWII have said that there were atrocities >on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans? Of course not.  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany either and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprisings did not have an army or a government. >>These people have been butchering each other for centuries.

I see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a colonizing power - driving away and/or eliminating the population of an area they want to control.  The US tried basically that in Vietnam the Iraqis in Kuwait the Israelis in Palestine South Africa etc etc etc.  It sucks it's ugly and it's saddening.  But it is not genocide. It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in Yugoslavia.  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked; they should surrender and evacuate the areas they can't hold. > [I said the fixation on Bosnia is due to it being in a European country >  rather than the third world] > >I recall before we did anything for Somalia (apparent) left-wingers saying >that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to >Somalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider >unworthy of help.

If >the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are >less like us why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us? >Especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think? Well one thing you have to remember is the press likes a good story.   Good for business don't you know.  And BTW not everyone wants to help the side that is less like us. I never said the two sides were morally equivalent I said neither one is innocent. There are just too many good reasons to stay away: 1) The Europeans are perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their borders in any way we do it.  Put another way we have no assistance to offer the Europeans which they do not already possess themselves.  It is not good to promote the idea in anyone's mind that the United States is responsible for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world. 2) Clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure.  Full stop. 3) It is by no means clear what intervention would accomplish nor that it would necessarily help the victims.  It is not clear what the goal is and at what point any commitment could be ended.

You know it is difficult for Europeans >to sell weapons when there is an embargo in place. During WWII the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite German occupation.  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides sponsoring peace conferences they would have no problem putting any kind of weapon they wanted into Bosnia. I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia including via third parties.  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active role would be too great.  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in the outcome of the war. >>I do not automatically accept the argument that Bosnia is any worse than >>other recent civil wars say Vietnam for instance.

Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press.  And that's about all we have to go on isn't it? And I wish you'd quit hurling words like racist around.  There are many levels at which people react to what they see.  At the most fundamental level you do not have to consciously recognize the racial element - you simply tend to empathize more with people who are like yourself.  As far preferring Christian over Moslem I am an atheist myself and I think you'll agree that in the US the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of religion nor give it a particularly important place in their world view.

UCS.UMASS.EDU (AFS) who wrote: [AFS]     Just a quick comment:: [AFS] [AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians. [AFS] [AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts? Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII BUT there was quite a difference in these two statements regardless of what Nazi revisionists say! [SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in [SY] todays Georgia. There were villages Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups) [SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother. [SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were [SY] different people. For example my grandfather would not have been happy [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors. OK. [SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my [SY] grandparents are concerned the Armenians attacked first but these [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people [SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so... There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915 with that of the Armeno- Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever killed in their collective existence but rather the wholesale destruction of Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian- Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak Lori and Pambak after the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region cannot be equated with the extermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier hundreds of kilometers away! [SY] Anyway but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people [SY] around people assumed that 'Armenians killed us raped our women' [SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps maybe backed [SY] by some powerful states... After that step you cannot explain these [SY] people not to hate all Armenians. I don't follow perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light. [SY] So what am I trying to point out? First at least for that region [SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation. [SY] Most of the Armenians I think are not to blame either. But since some [SY] people started that fire it is not easy to undo it. There are facts. [SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish [SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with [SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately [SY] very easy to start a fire! Again the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through Tiflis on their way to Baku in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians militarily. Of course as Turkish troops marched across what was left of Caucasian Armenia many Armenians went north and such population movement caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek -> Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> Massachusetts. [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience [SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands there were [SY] ladies old ladies all of her children killed while she forced to [SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves [SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail. My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian young man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive today. [SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense. [SY] They experienced their own pain of course. That is the way it is.  But [SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before.

It would be nice if as you rightly point out the inherent value of freedom of speech discussion would also deal with the all-to- frequent ritualized abuses and distortions of that freedom that do occur.

2,Dear Mr. Beyer: It is never wise to confuse freedom of speech with freedom of racism and violent deragatory. It is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial distinction. Indeed I find the latter in absolute and complete contradiction to the former. Racial invective tends to create an atmosphere of intimidation where certain individuals (who belong to the group under target group) do not feel the ease and liberty to exercise *their* fundamental freedom of speech. This brand of vilification is not sanctioned under freedom of speech. Salam John Absood Marlow ceased and sat apart indistinct and silent in the pose of a meditating Buddha.

In fact if a speach was not offensive to some its protection under Freedom of speach laws would be useless. It is speach that some find questionable that must be protected be it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist. It is only through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant. That is the idea behind freedom of expression. What you find offensive might be perceived as truth by some and what they might find offensive might be your belief. It is only through free exchange of ideas (and insults as the case seems to be with this channel) that one can change another's erring ways.That is why Jefferson said that here we are not afraid to tolerate error so long as reason is left to combat it.

2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Gaza and separation from Israel Gaza and the idea of separation The Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it is presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. We were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq Yossi Sarid - currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous statement: You look for me ! i.e. I'am not making any more efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it but whether or not the Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly MERETZ MK Deddi Tzuker recently faced with criticism from residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and peace responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists' perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR government regardless of what it does. These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the future of the Occupied Territories will look and they want to dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's government and from their point of view the expulsions were a marginal byproduct of this government of peace which need not disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the Rabinic policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it. But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has lost his way when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian workers or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing to propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the Palestinians let's build a fence so high that they won't be able to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation. Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): ...The liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical separation and 'the future of the territories' must come to understand that the regime of magnetic cards exclusion of Arab workers closure and curfew are instruments of enforcement designed for the suppression of a population in revolt and that their ideological support for separation only provides 'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status quo>. Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the ruling community but it is only the ruled population which bears its burden. [.....]. Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether this position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off responsibility for this concentration of human suffering and to thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue all their interests but is barred to the Arabs.... ------------------------------------------------------ >From The OTHER Front Jerusalem 10 March 1993

2,Many of you ask me whether I approve of severe human rights violations by Arab States becuse I focus on Israeli human rights violations. Let's make things clear: My opposition to H.R. violations in Arab States is total and without qualification. No Arab State is and can claim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic. I am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack of peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life. I am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come to it. Peace AND justice. If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states he should present his claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully entitled to make claims and should do so if they consider their case has a merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries if they wish. If not they should not complain and compare themselves to the Palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since Israel was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations quasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries they have a legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support. Human rights violations by Arab States don't justify legitimate nor are the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts. Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept which can only be implemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians. Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The first party has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier and the second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge some symmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realise the necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people and as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their own past towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948 etc.) and refuse to acknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal of most Palestinian Arabs there will be no base for a real trust. When I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villages destroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948 I got a shock. I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the meaning of such massive destruction and destitution. Elias Davidsson Iceland

Jordan Water to the Negev: A Strategic Asset XI.     The Negev Becomes a Dumping Ground XII.   The Dimona Nuclear Plant XIII.  The Negev as a Military Base XIV.  The Negev in the Year 2000 Just after the creation of the State of Israel the phrase the Jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom was trumpeted throughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967 David Ben-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: It's by our pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land into a fertile land created built-up areas towns and villages in abandoned desert areas. Contrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion it must be affirmed that during the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for centuries previous a productive human presence was to be found in all parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These were the Bedouin Arabs. The real desertification of the Negev mainly in the southern part occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's cultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays the majority of the 12800 square-kilometer Negev which represents 62 percent of the State of Israel (pre-1967 borders) has been desertified beyond recognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev are the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority whose chief role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture lands; and vast industrial zones including nuclear reactors and dumping grounds for chemical nuclear and other wastes. Israeli Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area cultivated by the Bedouin before 1948 and there is no Jewish pastoral activity. I. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin before and after 1948 -------------------------------------------------- In 1942 according to British mandatory statistics the Beersheba sub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev or Southern district) had 52000 inhabitants almost all Bedouin Arabs who held 11500 camels 6000 cows and oxen 42000 sheep and 22000 goats. The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in the north where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per year. In 1944 they cultivated about 200000 hectares of the Beersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more than double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers after 40 years of making the desert bloom* The Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of barley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming techniques were primitive but production was based solely on animal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal production although low was based entirely on pasturing. Production increased considerably during the rainy years and diminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture animals - goats camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many waterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the result of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh local conditions. After the creation of the State of Israel 80 percent of the Negev Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The 10000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev spring of life in the desert were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming. A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev. But after 1982 when the Sinai was returned to Egypt these Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army. No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of the 40000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities. Indeed most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven development towns or *sowetos* established for them. (the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson email: elias@ismennt.is)
2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Zionism - racism Diaspora 'a cancer' ------------------- by Julian Kossoff and Lindsay Schusman in: Jewish Chronicle London 22. Dec. 1989 Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator A.B. Yehoshua launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth Council meeting in North London last week. The diaspora he claimed was the cancer connected to the main tissue of the Jewish people. He was scathing about its failure to act before the Holocaust. He said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had ignored the warning signs in the 1920s and had fiercely opposed Zionism. Consequently he considered the Holocaust the failure of Judaism. His talk entitled Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution covered 5000 years of Jewish history. Mr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were he said not staying [in Israel] but running [away] and all Jews outside Israel who were using other people's countries like hotels. The only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was immoral because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived elsewhere. Worse it threatened Israel itself creating a distraction for her citizens who were leaving by the thousands. Mr. Yehoshua who described himself as a soldier for aliyah ended by calling for the creation of a new total Jew living in Israel. Earlier speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the difficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature Mr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the country's political situation. He said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital source of inspiration.  Today Israeli writers avoided writing directly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been produced about the intifada. Instead writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity emigration from Israel and personal and family issues. Mr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the Israeli political situation. He could no longer step into an Israeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real flesh and blood character. He claimed that after 40 years of statehood the problem of Israeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too pre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew and were not concerned with the nature of that identity. Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life unlike in the diaspora where Jews had no responsibility for the country they lived in he said. He warned that modern Hebrew a unifying force for the Jewish people would have to struggle for its future especially in literary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English language. -------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the contrary their standard of living has climbed sharply; many of them now live in rather nice permanent houses and own cars. There are quite a few Beduin students in the Ben-Gurion university.

Well that's the way it all was but I never thought of course that it would spill over into a bloody tragedy because you just couldn't imagine it. Here we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years and no one even considered such an idea possible. But I had been forming my own opinions and in the presence of authoritative people I would often ask Where is this all leading do people really not see what kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait there are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this what's going on? And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th it became clear that everything had been arranged by someone because what else are you to make of it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the demonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I hadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were under guard in the SK club on the 1st he came to the club that Muslimzade. The women told me There he is there he is that's Muslimzade. I didn't believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that they were just false rumors. I went over to him and said Are you the First Secretary of our City Party Committee? He answers me Yes. And I ask him Tell me did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani flag and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs I don't know exactly what they said but there was mention of Armenian blood? And he tells me Yes I was there but I tried to dissuade them from it. Then I asked him another question: And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering us? And he said I. . . We didn't know what to do we didn't know we didn't anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait. Comrade Mamedov the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani SSR answered the same question for me: No we actually didn't anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain the crowd of 45000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre. Those are his exact words the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR. And now about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them because it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors concerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true others aren't. But unfortunately there are more true ones than false because it was so horrible: in our age here in the space age the age of science the age of progress I don't know if someone had told me this story if I were living in or around Moscow I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really a genocide it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was. For example on that day the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my husband and I were both sick both of us had the flu and we were in bed--on the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says You're in bed? You don't know anything about it? There was a demonstration in town and after it they were overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars and asking 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian then they turned the car over and burned it. This isn't made up the wife of the Senior Investigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was returning home from his dacha with his wife Raisa Sevastyanova she's my neighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the middle of it I don't know what to call it the cavalcade of automobiles they were stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani they let them go but they made him honk the horn they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it and I said Certainly that didn't happen how can that be? And she said Muslimzade was leading the crowd and the Sputnik store was completely smashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw that they had started breaking the glass in that store he said Don't break the shop windows don't destroy state property but do whatever else you want.  I didn't hear this with my own two ears but it is a fact that the store was torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians although he's an Azerbaijani. While we were talking all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and say Look there's a crowd out there. And sure enough when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had already started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian family there a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry I don't know the building number or the people's names since we were in my husband's apartment in Microdistrict 8 and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. There was awful looting going on there at the time the most hideous things were going on there then. One building there ours was attacked twice once wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished the Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians they beat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians if it was Russians doing the hiding. Because there were Russians among them they said so on television there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell us why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes. At the time I saw this from the window I was there Sevastyanova was there and so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony. All kinds of things even a sofa. Then when it was all down there they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd and they were all oohing. At first I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband Lendrush l think they're beating someone out there. And he answered I don't know could be. Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment and I saw it and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way he didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell down it was muddy there and later other witnesses who saw it from their balconies told us they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of blocks as far as the mortgage bank that's a good block and a half or two from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself. Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there and you can of course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented that woman because I had just seen that. I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said You kill me first and then let them do what they want with the corpse. But our neighbors it's true defended us they said There aren't any Armenians in our entryway go away only Muslims live here. Disaster missed us that time. But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people approximately came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's upset about something but I can't. I was standing running from balcony to balcony. Our power was out I don't remember for how long but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever and I was glad of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first time they were at our building it was 6:30 and now it was 2:15 in the morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor the Azerbaijani was awake and watching out there were human beings among them too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage as though she needed to be taking garbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said What do you want? And they answered We want the Armenian family that lives here [pointing toward the second floor with their hands]. She says I already told you we don't have any Armenians here now leave do you hear this is an old Muslim woman talking to you and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they seemed to listen to her. They were all very young they started apologizing and left. That was the second time death was at our door. I forgot to mention about one other apartment a man named Rubik lives there I don't know him really I knew his daughter I mean I saw her around but we really didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight months to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to earn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage but alas everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything out the windows and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that hadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means that the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foreseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of apartments. Something on the order of We'll move the Armenians out and take over their apartments. I have worked honestly my whole life you can check everything about me. I came as a patriot from China waited for nights on end in front of the Consulate General of the USSR I came to my homeland as a patriot because I knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in Sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them that Party membership was bought that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain that there were no ideals no ideas God save me everything was being bought and sold I saw all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did. I can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I went out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard they had arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians but some Russian families and their children too came out of their apartments and joined us because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with the situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people for sure people would basically rise to the situation would have some compassion for the Armenians would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But having analyzed and weighed the whole thing once I calmed down having thought it all through I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed and that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to calm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute Go and announce it on television: Citizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands let's protect our neighbors from this massacre? Those crowds weren't such that there was no controlling them. Bas

Like it or not Edward Anwar has a very good valid point.  Obviously in presenting it he (quite legitimately and deliberately) takes a point of view to an extreme which might not have been what you intended but that is one of the best ways to demonstrate a slippery slope type of argument which I believe was his aim. I very frankly believe that the ADL will be proved innocent in this case.  I doubt there's enough evidence to weigh against them even in a civil court where preponderance of the evidence not evidence beyond any reasonable doubt is the standard for winning such a case.  That however does not prevent me from seeing the merit in Anwar's point.

2,From: _Quantum_ Magazine March/April 1993 pages 42-46 The Problem Book of Anania of Shirak ------------------------------------ On the ancient peak of Ararat The centuries have come like seconds And passed on. -Avetik Issahakian by Yuri Danilov Some years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: What books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight? And though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30 depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes ages and professions not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at least one book of arithmetic problems. Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for numbers (though secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin a specialist in statistics wrote about arithmetic: I willingly confess that any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem it was a hard work for me and sometimes I failed completely. Of course like most of my friends I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route --constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way it's a fact that is well known and oft repeated that as a rule neither high school graduates nor students at teaching colleges nor teachers beginning their careers (nor I must add scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade teachers. Now I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to recommend one particular problem book one that will satisfy the most fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say to Venus and back. One for the road They both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. God knows what this kind of stuff leads to thought Kingsley. The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History of Herodotus. Good Lord next he'll be reading Thucydides thought the Royal Astronomer. --Fred Hoyle The Black Cloud The book I'm talking about isn't very big but its 24 problems constitute 24 elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same time rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period these problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian architecture the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant letters of the Armenian alphabet invented by Mesrop Mashtots or the songs of Komitas or the paintings of Saryan. An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions of Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli Petrograd 1918). The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just anyone see it. Even now after research by K. P. Patkanov the learned monk Father Kaloust J.I. Orbeli A. Abramyan V. K. Chaloyan and others has brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles the general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable problem book. Vardapet Anania of Shirak Once fell in love with the art of calculation I thought that no philosophical notion can be constructed without number considering it the mother of all wisdom. --Anania of Shirak Among ancient Armenian thinkers Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and Solutions the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars: On Weights and Measures Cosmography and Calendrical Theory and Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia Movses of Khoren). In his autobiography Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself: I Anania of Shirak having studied all the science of our Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately in the expression of the psalmist every day I illuminated the eyes of my mind. Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy the mother of all sciences without number. I could find in Armenia neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but only of certain fragmentary facts. I then went to Constantinople where I met acquaintances who told me: Why did you go so far when much closer to us in Trebizon on the coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full of wisdom is known to kings and knows Armenian literature. I asked them how they knew this. They answered: We saw ourselves that many people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople Philagrus traveled with us bringing many young persons to become pupils of Tyukhik. When I heard this I expressed my gratitude to God who had quenched the thirst of His slave. I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I had come. He received me graciously and said: I praise Our Lord that He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there. Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated the science of number and with such success that my fellow students at the king's court began to envy me. I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable collection of books: secret and explicit ecclesiastical and pagan books on art history and medicine books of chronologies. Why enumerate them by title? In a word there is no book that Tyukhik did not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into Armenian he did not struggle as other translators did and the translation read as if the work were written in that language originally. Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had learned the Armenian language. When I was young he said I lived in Trebizon at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus and for a long time up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks I was wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to the Lord to heal my wounds I made a promise: If You prolong my life I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to collecting treasures of knowledge. And the Lord heard my prayers. After I recovered I went to Jerusalem and from there to Alexandria and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople I met a famous philosopher from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people. After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for him the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik citing the promise he made to God not to move far from the city turned down the offer. But because of his wide leaning people came streaming from all countries to study with him. And I the most insignificant of all Armenians having learned from him this powerful science desired by kings brought it to our country supported by no one obligated only to my own industry God's help and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me for my efforts. Problems and Solutions A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum and forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so find how many copies were printed in all. --Imitation of Anania of Shirak A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (books have their own fate). The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The manuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because according to Armenian historians in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded from invaders like weapons and cherished like one's own children. Biding their time the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran a renowned depository of ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts). And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two manuscripts to publish the problem book supplementing it with an introduction and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian edited annotated and typeset by Iosef Orbeli a prominent scholar (and later a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR). In the translator's words the problems of Anania are amusing full of life and simple. Orbeli goes on to say: The subjects of the problems are generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland Shirak and the surrounding countryside and the dramatis personae if they are named are the local princes--the Kamsarakans including Nersekh who was a contemporary of Anania. Like other ancient authors Anania of Shirak used only aliquots -- that is fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1 one has to represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above). Like any true work of art the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages. Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. 572. Problem 1 My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the Armenians and the Persians prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. The first time he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time pursuing the Persians he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third time he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were still alive numbering two hundred eighty fled to Nakhichevan. And so from this remainder find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre. Problem 8 During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians when Zaurak Kamsarakan killed Suren one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the Persian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a day. Fifteen days later when he learned of this Zaurak Kamsarakan sent riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in a day. And so find how many days it took them to catch the envoy. Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian translation they are all called dishes. But in the original Armenian according to Orbeli's note the dishes in the first and second instances are called mesur and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian word but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before Anania's Problems and Solutions. Problem 18 There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth another mesur; from one fifth two goblets; from one sixth two scutels; and from two hundred ten drams I made a bowl. And now find the weight of the tray. Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in Anania's time -- for instance problem 7. Problem 7 Once I was in Marmet the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank of the river Akhuryan I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. We caught a half and a quarter of the school and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel I found forty-five fishes. And now find how many fishes here were in all. The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself and offer you just one more. Problem 20 provides some interesting information

2,The latest Israeli proposal first proposed in February of 1992 contains the following assumptions concerning the nature of any interim status refering to the WB and Gaza the Palestinians implemented by negotiations. It states that: >Israel will remain the existing source of authority until final status is agreed upon; >Israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the Interim Self-Government Arrangements (ISGA); >The ISGA will apply to the Palestinian inhabitants of the territories under Israeli military administration. The arrangements will not have a territorial application nor will they apply to the Israeli population of the territories or to the Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem; >Residual powers not delegated under the ISGA will be reserved by Israel; >Israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd; >Israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects- external internal- and for the maintenance of public order; >The organs of the ISGA will be of an administrative-functional nature; >The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and coordination with Israel. >Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the areas of administration justice personnel agriculture education business tourism labor and social welfare local police local transportation and communications municipal affairs and religious affairs. Several question do come to mind concerning the success we all hope for in the ongoing negotiation process. These arrangements certainly seem to be essentially a rejection of any Palestinian interim self-control. Without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible vulnerability can Israel reasonably put forward (at later points in the negotiating process) more relaxed proposals for thisinterim period? How should proposals (from either side) be altered to temper their maximalist approaches as stated above? How can Israeli worries and desire for some interim control be addressed while providing for a very *real* interim Palestinian self-governing entity?

If you want to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news directly from the source. EVERY news source is inherently biased to some extent and for various reasons both intentional and otherwise. However the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the truth and to discern the bias. Go read or listen to some Israeli media. You will learn more news and more opinion about Israel and Palestine by doing so. Then you can form your own opinions and hopefully they will be more informed even if your views don't change.

We ran into one of my relatives at the bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening and then a fellow I know comes up to me an Azerbaijani guy and says What are you standing here for? Go home immediately! I asked What's going on? He says What's the matter can't you see they've overturned a car and they're killing Armenians! He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely. We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They were shouting something but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice or two all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35. They went up to the third _floor and we see that they're breaking glass and throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one has a pair of jeans in his hands another has a tape recorder and a third a guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store. We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School No. 33 which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only known Ernest before he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to but there was nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We were told that on that day the 1st there would be an attack on our microdistrict. We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor. On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I asked him for assistance. I say We're in School No. 33 we need to be evacuated. Well he says Got it wait there I'm sending out help now. I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant I had spoken with him personally. When I called he said Muslimzade here. About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying Armenians come out we're here to get you. They have clubs axes and armature shafts in their hands. The guard sat there with us and asked Where should I go? I say If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that the Armenians were here and that they left. That's what he did. He went down there and said The Armenians were here he said I let them out the back door they went that way. And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed. So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help all right! Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school no one knew that we were there. In any case we stayed at the school until seven in the morning and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid. In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1 and the soldiers took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people and there were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy about three months old died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor nothing. The boy was uninjured there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation they did everything they could under the circumstances but were unable to save him. And his mother and father a young Armenian couple were right there on the floor ... I searched for a spot for us in the SK we have a small child of our own I wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third floor there were a lot of soldiers up there bandaged with canes limping with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys all of them. There were a lot of bandaged Armenians too. Everyone had been beaten everyone was crying wailing and calling for help. I think that the City Party Committee ignored us completely. True there was a snack bar: a sausage was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being sold for 50 a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to get the things any cheaper. I met my old uncle Aram Mikhailovich there. He saw me and tears welled up in his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples that we worked together he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw me and there was nothing he could say he just cried. You can understand his feelings of course.

2,Andy Beyer has claimed that the Israeli Press is a bit biased. But the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the mideast that people who do not read the Israeli press simply know nothing about.  Many of these events are not even mentioned here. I read the Israeli press to learn of important events about which you know nothing because of your total reliance on western media for your information on Israel.  Since I read both American media and Israeli media I can say with absolute certainty that anybody who reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about Israel does not have a true picture of what is going on. As to the claim that Israeli papers are biased of course they are.  Some may lean to the right or the left just like the media here in America.  But they still report events about which people here know nothing.  I choose to form my opinions about Israel and the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average American who relies exclusively on an American media which does not report on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy.

Failing to do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is.

It is also interesting to note that at the outbreak of the intifada palestinian parties quickly began orchestrating their demonstrations for the benefit of the media.  Having spoken to a Danish reporter who covered the initfada I know of at least one case where he found out that a mass demonstration on the outskirts of Gaza was setup for himself and his colleagues.

Someone else said something similar.  I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias's proposal.  I just want to say that it is very distressing that at least two people here are profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOT like Elias's idea they were more like the opposite. Nazis believed in racial purity not racial assimilation.  An instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to Nazi theoreticians Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted and in huge numbers murdered because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but mongrels formed from the pure Gypsy race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies by the way.  It is also true that towards the end of WWII even the purist Gypsies were hunted down as the theory was forgotten. Brendan. (email:  bdm@cs.anu.edu.au)

Of course you never read Arab media I read Arab ISRAELI (Jer.

Why no +10?

Using bombers and artillery against Lebanese towns and villages. Using fire arms and lethal variants of tear gas and *rubber coated* bullets against stone throwers. Using tanks and anti-tank missiles against homes after a 5 minute evacuation warning.  Using Shin Bit's reasonable physical pressure in interrogation. And more. Not counting of course past practices such as the bombardment of Beirut in 1982 the bombing of the Egyptian school of Bahr-El-Bakar and the Abu-Za'bal factory in 1978 the downing of the Libyan airliner full of Egyptian passengers near the same time. Overseeing the Maronite massacre in Sabra and Shatilla. That is of course besides numerous massacres by Irgun and other gangs during the British mandate period. Ironically the same Op-Ed page in the NYT times from which the Naftaly copied this article was running another article next to it by A.M. Rosenthall blaming Bosnian Muslims for their own genocide by effectively saying that it is stupid to seek independence if independence will bring your people slaughter.

First I believe that my statement applies to both sides. Having said that I think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately negotiable and what is not. For example no country has the right to abuse one's human rights. Deciding whether there will be one or two states in Palestine is a legitimate question.

With a strong Lebanese government (free from Syrian and Israeli interference) I believe that the border could be adequately patrolled. The Palestinian heavy weapons have been siezed in past years and I do not see as significant a threat as once existed. Please Tim don't fall into the trap of treating Lebanese and Palestinians as all part of the same group. There are too many who think all Arabs or all Muslims are the same. Too many times I have seen people support the bombing of Palestinian camps in retaliation for an IDF death at the hands of the Lebanese Resistance or the shelling of Lebanese villages in retaliation for a Palestinian attack. |> Tim

It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the Bible (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement! >(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity >since it was coined by Bnai Brith) As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views. > >What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in as far as I can get from the Arab media >is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic >Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in >Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants. > What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same situation when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not I have another suggested reading for you... get into the soc.culture.arabic newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic Jews in the Qu'ran (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 situation in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think? >However whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture blowing up their >homes murders...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political >thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the >Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice. All I have to say to that is once again see s.c.a - Jews in the Qu'ran and think again.  Freedom of choice is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state). > >As for the PLO I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind. > Probably nothing!

Those who forward offensive posts to the sysadmin aren't curtailing anyones' freedom of speech.  The neo-nazi movement has a right to make speeches say anything they want.  They do not have a right to have these speeches published by the N.Y. Times.  That depends on the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent newsworthy value of those speeches.  Likewise to the sysadmin of this fellows system.  If he feels his resources are being used in a manner that is not in his best interests or are perhaps embarassing to his organization he will act just as the New York Times does not to be a conduit for these ideas. The poster is after all free-loading off of someone else's pocket book when he posts.  He who controls the purse strings has the right to make the decision how he wants those funds spent or not spent. Noone is going to put the poster in jail unless he bombs a local building as a symbol of his hatred.  Freedom of Speech in no way equates to accessibility to conduits of information.  The market of ideas has its own natural selection process that weeds out the ga-ga from the credible ideas that are of importance.

The Turks blatantly rejected this treaty(the Germans grudgingly accepted Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the German people).The Greeks who had an army therewere there with BRITISH and FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres. In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak alliesthis was after the Greek forces were were destroyed at Smyrna.When this occurred incidently FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH as they clawed they're way up the sides of the ships.

In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul. It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us create for ourselves.

(Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - Preserving the Armenian purity) During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920 the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1000 year homeland. The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

True it may sometimes be difficult or Still living in an alternate universe? Numerous articles in major newspapers (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war had suggested the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history. Concurrently Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control' or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger Armenian community in the United States he marginalized collaboration as deplorable but insignificant.[1] [1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian) 'The Plotters' E. P. Dutton & Company Inc. New York 1946 p. 182. Source: Mitteilungsblatt Berlin December 1939 Nr. 2 and 5-6 Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately forgotten concealed and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi collaboration. A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the magazine which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation is attention-getting. This magazine every issue of which proves the collaboration is historically important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. In Nazi Germany Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain political economic and social rights were thus granted to them. They occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices. The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered Aryan and what befell them. Now wait there is more. Source: From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne by Avetis Aharonian. The Armenian Review Vol. 16 No. 3-63 Autumn Sep. 1963 pp. 47-57. p. 52 (second paragraph).

2,Referring to notes from the personal diary of Russian General L. Odishe Liyetze on the Turkish front he wrote On the nights 11-12 March 1918 alone Armenian butchers bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits most likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish Muslims in groups of 80. My adjutant counted and unearthed 200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization. On March 12 1918 Lieut-colonel Griyaznof wrote (from an official Russian account of the Turkish genocide) Roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos dismembered joints and carved out organs of Muslim peasants... alas! mainly of women and children.

Document No: 77 Archive No: 1-2 Cabin No: 10 Drawer No: 4 File No: 410 Section No: 1578 Contents No: 1-12 1-18. (Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov) The things I have heard and seen during the two months until the liberation of Erzurum by the Turks have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious degenerate characteristic of the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum no Armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs. While the Commander of the First Army Corps General Kaltiyin remained in power troops including Armenian enlisted men were not sent to the area. When the security measures were lifted the Armenians began to attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war. One day while passing through the streets on horseback a group of soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud and dirt... It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night patrol did not return and no one knew what had happened to them. The Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also. Finally the Court Martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder and rape which had decreased began to occur more frequently. Sometime in January and February a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir Efendi from Erzurum was killed one night at his home. The Commander in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days. The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned. ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief Odishelidge. They were as follows: The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers and the act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades... More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later the murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses: 'Seventy dead bodies well this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten more Turks would be cut into pieces thrown into the hole and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil. The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty Turks and cut their heads off one by one. Following the Erzincan massacre the Armenians began to withdraw towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road and destroyed the entire population together with the villages. During the transportation of the cannons ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area certain people were hired among the Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers were passing through Erzurum the Armenians took advantage of the time when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying Kurds they attempted to help them. However the Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened and thus prevented them from acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing. Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However since the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony the Armenian failed in his attempt. Having seen this the Armenian ripped open the abdomen of the Kurd disembowelled him and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot. Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov who passed through the village of Ilica three weeks after the massacre told us the following: There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces on the roads. Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads cursed and spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter square dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder. A few educated Armenian girls who worked as telephone operators for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told the girls that the Armenians including women were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous. An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on February 20: The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head. The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts. The others the Armenians claimed were released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the Armenian officers Karagodaviev. Today some Turks were murdered on the streets. On February 12 some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for murdering an innocent Turk. When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would be hanged for his crime the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum the Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17 I heard that the entire population of Tepekoy village situated within the artillery area had been totally annihilated. On the same day when Antranik entered Erzurum I reported the massacre to him and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act. However no result was achieved. In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred there was a natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February the Armenians deceived the Russians perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the Turkish soldiers. Later it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons for one night and ran away. The leading Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre. However the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre just as in all the others. The lower classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders. No for there were people who opposed the Armenians for such actions since they understood that it would yield no result. However such people were only a minority. Furthermore such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly. Some on the other hand preferred to remain silent. There were certain others who when accused by the Russians of infamy would say the following: 'You are Russians. You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the Turkish soldiers.

2,Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet Armenia. The following letter which represents a small portion of the full text along with more than 200 pages of historical documents scholarly sources eyewitness accounts and photographs was sent to President Bill Clinton members of Congress editors program directors and columnists of major newspapers journals and radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year the people of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and prosperously. ------------------------- letter ---------------------------------- During the years of World War I the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland which is the crux of Turkish political demands fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways: 1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility. 2. x-Soviet Armenia employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide. 3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests. 4. Using all its human financial and governmental resources x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism bribery and other subversive methods non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause be they political governmental and humanitarian. Using all the aforementioned methods the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue. Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations in the last decades thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide. With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand: 1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship recognize the Turkish Genocide; 2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people; 3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide; 4. that all world governments and especially the United States officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure; 5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally x-Soviet Armenia and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands; 6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books. The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment politically mature and conscious who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause through all necessary means ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. Therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in the political cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people. Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.' (Ohanus Appressian - 1919) 'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

Israel has a right to keep Jerusalem for many reasons.  They include the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli the fact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people and the historical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem. When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948 the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit religious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a Jewish cemetary into a hotel and used the gravestones in their latrines. Israel has allowed individuals of all religions into Jerusalem protected holy sites and demonstrated its fitness to control the city. Also I should point out that Islam is not centered in Jerusalem but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).  Unlike Israeli Jerusalem Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca.

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their plan ! (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith) What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in as far as I can get from the Arab media is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants. However whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture blowing up their homes murders...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice. As for the PLO I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind. Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion. Ahmed. Forget the syntax Ahmed and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that the PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly obvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo 1968). The covenant calls for the destruction of the Zionist entity. As far as I know the Israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies the purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like I can post the relevant caluses. Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical it seems. I know it has been posted here several times and while I do not have a copy of it I am sure that someone does and he (or she of course) would be more than happy to repost it. Regardless of phrasing groups like Hamas and the Hezbollah and even the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO have at the very heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel. It just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson's suggestion that Jews support people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing one to many Jews. Harry.

Oh yeah Israel was really ready to expand its borders on the holiest day of the year (Yom Kippur) when the Arabs attacked in 1973.  Oh wait you chose to omit that war...perhaps because it 100% supports the exact OPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make?  I don't think that it's because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also in 1967 it was Egypt not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956 Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli shipping a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan Heights.  Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel finally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that the borders could be expanded.

You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured these Arabs could return to their former homes reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews.  When the Arabs lost Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country. >8.

Although the major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular) due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath. There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state but by Rabbis and Priests.  Obviously your disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about.

2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis To:  shaig@Think.COM Subject: Ten questions to Israelis Dear Shai Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory. In the answer to my first question concerning the nonexistence of Israeli nationality your answer conflicts with information I have received from other quarters according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship (Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports etc and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all times and present them at many public places almost every day. These ID cards make clear who the holder is a Jew or an Arab. You maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ? Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ? In the answer to my second questions concerning the fact that Israel has no fixed borders you state that Israel's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I read the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century had plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders when Israel was established as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the land to them. But according to biblical sources the area God promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use today ?  Finally if Israel wants peace why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders which might be a base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind one cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism as a number of wars have proved (1948 1956 1967 1982). Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said the truth then why should he been punished and if he lied why should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty. Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question concerning 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do exist in Israel. What do you think about that ? You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing they would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about Israel were just fabrications but alas you have failed to do so. I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion. This is a sign of weakness not of strength. I hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth.
2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis Dear Josh I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions. Having said that I am not totally happy with your answers. 1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S. citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests ? 2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy. You did not respond to my question. 3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is interesting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ? 4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a Ma'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned. 5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares one for the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law). The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron it seems. If so why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ? 6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told namely that hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of 1947-8 were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also left for example to Europe to avoid the clashes were allowed to return. How can you justify such discrimination if this is true ? Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland ? 7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that information Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh about 50000 people.  These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem published by Cambridge University Press. Is this book available in your library ? 8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very little evidence available about that. As much as I know many Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim even for many years but are not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs ? 9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious communities in the U.S. would be asked they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory. I would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments. Elias

Otherwise back to your own league son. I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles.  This Andi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism yet because he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion you attack him.  Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi's question in an intelligent and unoffending manner?  The only ones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact are the Israelophiles.  Now will we please start having some INTELLIGENT conversation?  You all are an insult to you race! {assuming you are also semitic} Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism during the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun and other branch - off militant groups did fight the British do get them out of Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British soldiers but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition they massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948 contributing to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their very lives. I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the Jews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for German and European anti semitism.

You're right!  Andi shouldn't be comparing Israel to the Nazis.  The Israelis are much worse than the Nazis ever were anyway.  The Nazis did a lot of good for Germany and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the damn Jews.  The Holocaust never happened anyway.  Ample evidence given by George Schafer at Harvard Dept. of History and even by Randolph Higgins at NYU have shown that the Holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain sympathy to piush for the creation of Israel.

2,Although I realize that principle is not one of your strongest points I would still like to know why do do not ask any question of this sort about the Arab countries. If you want to continue this think tank charade of yours your fixation on Israel must stop.  You might have to start asking the same sort of questions of Arab countries as well.  You realize it would not work as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the last several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would begin to look like the biased attack that it is. Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for Policy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot who hates Israel. Why don't you try being honest about your hatred of Israel?  I have heard that your family once lived in Israel but the members of your family could not cut the competition there.  Is this true about your family?  Is this true about you?  Is this actually not about Israel but is really a personal vendetta?  Why are you not the least bit objective about Israel?  Do you think that the name of your phony-baloney center hides your bias in the least?  Get a clue Mr. Davidsson.  Haven't you realized yet that when you post such stupidity in this group you are going to incur answers from people who are armed with the truth?  Haven't you realized that a piece of selective data here and a piece there does not make up a truth?  Haven't you realized that you are in over your head?  The people who read this group are not as stupid as you would hope or need them to be.  This is not the place for such pseudo-analysis. You will be continually ripped to shreds until you start to show some regard for objectivity.  Or you can continue to show what an anti-Israel zealot you are trying to disguise your bias behind a pompous name like the 'Center for Policy Research.'  You ought to know that you are a laughing stock your 'Center' is considered a joke and until you either go away or make at least some attempt to be objective you will have a place of honor among the clowns bigots and idiots of Usenet.

Trying to make comparisons between Israels politics and Nazi German- Austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance (high) intellect (low) humanity (none) and antisemitism (average). I respect anybody who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a civilized manner. I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel and/or its politics is an antisemite except he uses antisemitic vocabulary/terminology/demagogy. Israel is not a perfect country and its politicians also commits errors even some of them are corrupt (like politicians in any other country) but they carry a huge burden: to care for the safety of ALL its citizens and that is really not an easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country (and its Jewish citizens plus the so-called collaborators arabs that wanted to live in peace with their Jewish neighbours) of the map. As I said Israel is not a perfect country but it is the ONLY democracy in the whole Middle-East and the only country in the world where Jews from everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries they are living. Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on non-Jewish nations and its governments: as soon as there are more or les big social-economical-political problems in any country the first ones that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews and later the other minorities of the country. > I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government. Any > attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself anti-semetic is > not appreciated. This is really outrageous: 6.000.000 murdered Jews besides the thousands  who survived the Shoa in some way or another and the rest of the living ones mourning for all of them ! I don't know what you call a Civil Libertarian (never heard about them) but I know only one thing: if all of them think like you do it then Civil Libertarians is a new denomination for Antisemites. May other Civil Libertarians come to word to this group so that we can learn if A.Beyer and me are right (that Civil Libertarians are Antisemites) or that I'm wrong and he is missusing that word.

You are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used.  True by law all residents citizens and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For citizens the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves on a daily basis wherein they are presented at public places is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place in banks (cashing checks) post offices (registered mail and such) etc... Quite frankly it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card for such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public. Furthermore none of the services I outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information. The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police based upon the scenario.  In general though arab citizens are clearly recognizable as are non-arabs.

I think that Arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from Israeli expansionism. Militarily Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile armed and insurgent population for a sustained period of time.  As is the intifada is heavily taxing the Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the Awali and later from the Litani in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire. Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it. With regards to borders let me state the following.  I may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state smaller borders then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible. |> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public |> official.

For disclosing state secrets after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public one should be punished. As to which were and which weren't I am under no moral obligation to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact. He was taken to court tried and found guilty.

I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill as tightly knit as Israel even if the matter of the arrest was not made public within a relatively short time frame most people would know about it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.

To use your own example these questions might have been lifted from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture. My answers were not any more hysterical than the questions themselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative it was that they were selective in their fact seeking.

In the portion of the province which lies in the plains they were able to carry out their purpose and the manner in which this was done will be referred to in due course.

Now explain this: The number of Turks in >Thrace has steadily risen from 50000 in 23 to 80000 while the Greeks of Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However in today's informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For instance those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what really happened. There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital The Greek Girls' Lycee Alumni Association the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society the Greek Medical Foundation the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation and the Fener Greek Men's Lycee Foundation. As for Greece the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been active until 1984. But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. This is also the final verdict (November 4 1987) of the Greek High Court. In the city of Komotini a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish parentage was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment with no right to appeal just for saying outloud that he was of Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than a vehicle used by the Greek governments to cover-up their inferiority complex they display vis-a-vis the people of Turkiye. The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks' which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people whom all the three nations (Bulgarians Turks and Greeks) consider as part of themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized according to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.' It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091 virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority as state official. Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. Talk about democracy. The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic convention in Komotini. Such destruction which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' Greek Constitution which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments. The government of Greece on the other hand is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward Hellenizing the region. And you pondered. Sidiropoulos the president of the Macedonian Human Rights Committee became the latest victim of a tactic long used by the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of Kefalonia hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. His employer the Florina City Council asked him to depart in 24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice and remains without a job. Helsinki Watch a well-known Human Rights group had been investigating the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990 their findings were published in a report titled 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.' The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in Komotini. Such destruction which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the Lausanne Convention. The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik were attacked and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in Karotas was razed by bulldozers. Shall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks in Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians. It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile Greek and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern Cyprus a process that will conflict with the spirit of the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe. An acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will. But we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana. Now wait there is more.

The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus and the 90 Turkish travellers men and women who were in it ordered to descend.

Let us not forget the Nazi Armenians. Nazi Armenians were of service to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it one well-known case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism. In Russia General Dro (the Butcher) the architect of the Turkish genocide in WWI was working closely with the German Secret Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable source for the Germans.[2] [1] Meyer Berkian ibid. p. 150.

Between 1914 and 1920 2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia. They were persecuted banished and slaughtered while much of Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide as acting with a 'specific intent to destroy in whole or in substantial part a national ethnic racial or religious group.' History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy as a massacre of the Kurds Turks and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established beyond any doubt that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian territories. The Muslims of Van Bitlis Mus Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon Tercan Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government. The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro Antranik Armen Garo Hamarosp Daro Pastirmadjian Keri Karakin Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells they were locked in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to. Including women and children such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled everything that the people had has been taken away from them and we found them in a destitute situation.

Deal? Democracy in action. Are you the 'truelove' or 'falselove' of 'Arromdian' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle? If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the nations which they brought under their power to which no one could have opposed today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody to worship in their own way centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries.[1] The Turks who are a conquering nation did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule; instead they respected their religions and traditions. It was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a Romanian nation today (Popescu Ciocanel). Turks rule over people under their administration only externally without interfering with their internal structures. On account of this the autonomy of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced European countries.[2] ...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too or if it did not keep translating itself into action many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves happy! (A. de Mortraye).[3] Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition. On the contrary it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens even today. In Turkey however if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities local courts immediately take them under their protection. In that vast and calm country of the sultan all religions and nations are living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue it does not replace them. Because of this the Catholic sect is more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this sect neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the dead are being taken to the graves a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the Eucharist celebrations chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of priests.

Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on the part of the Jews and a massacre defines it best in my opinion.  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the Jews a peace pact but the Irgun purposely broke this agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians.  I might grant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] but nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun.  The Deir Yassin MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland....and contrary to your belief many civilians were killed.  Deir Yassin was later advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was useful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinians were rightfully scared off because they did not want another Deir Yassin. I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here; atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs. Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are and were the good guys in the middle east.  Both Arab and Jew suck equally.

I agree with all you write except that Terrorist orgs. were not shelling Israel from the Golan Heights in 1982 but rather from Lebanon. The Golan Heights have been held by Israel since 1967 and therefore the PLO could not have been shelling Israel from there unless there is something I am not aware of.

Born 1959 Teacher Sumgait Secondary School No. 10 Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No. 10 Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office Resident at Building 17/33B Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan] [Note: The events in Kafan used as a pretext to attack Armenians in Azerbaijan are false as verified by independent International Human Rights organizations - DD] I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in Armenia now. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the price was too great! Now after the Sumgait tragedy we the victims divide our lives into before and ''after. We talk like that: that was before the war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole epoch a fate. No matter how many years go by no matter how long we live it will never be forgotten. On the contrary some of the moments become even sharper: in our rage in our sorrow we saw everything differently but now . . . They say that you can see more with distance and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened. Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and those who didn't. That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family although you could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was near and possible so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least as my parents say at least we should have done something to save the children. My parents themselves are not that old 52 and 53 years. But then they thought that they had already lived enough and did everything they could to save us. In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28 around five in the afternoon. I call it a tragedy and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls; even now among Armenians among people who wish me only well I feel like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a hospitable family and we just never really thought about whether the people who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis Jews or Russians. We had friends of many nationalities even a Turkmen woman. My parents were in the hall my father with an axe. I remember him telling my mother Run to the kitchen for a knife. But Mother was detached pale as though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never expected it of her she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A girlfriend was at the house that day a Russian girl Lyuda and Mamma said No matter what happens no matter what they do to us you're not to come out of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment. We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl crawled under the bed and we covered them up with a rug boxes of dishes and Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to embrace her and kiss her as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina was thinking the same thing but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. There was so much noise from the tramping of feet from the shouting and from excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her I had wanted to hold her back but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me at least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting all of their eyes were shining all red like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst in but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They came into the hall into the kitchen and dragged my father into the other room. He didn't utter a word he just raised the axe to hit them but Mamma snatched the axe from behind and said Tell them not to touch the children. Tell them they can do as they want with us but not to harm the children. She said this to Father in Armenian. There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: You and your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women our girls our mothers they cut their breasts off and burned our houses . . .  and so on and so forth and we came to do the same thing to you. This whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They were mostly young people under 30. At first there weren't any older people among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town all the same and we know a lot of people by their faces especially me I'm a teacher. So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took him in there no they didn't take him in there they dragged him in there because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father what they were doing to him. Then a young man about 26 years old started to tear off Mamma's sarafan and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: I'm old enough to be your mother! What are you doing?! He struck her. Now he's being held Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader as though she were trying to lead them down a different path as they say to influence their consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong that they mustn't do it. She said Come on let's straighten this out without emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we ever do to you? Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come into our home but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and coming--said What are you talking to them for. You should kill them. We came here to kill them. They pushed Karina struck her and she fell down. They beat her but she didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off she kept repeating What did we do to you? What did we do to you? And even later when she came to she said Mamma what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us? That group was prepared I know this because I noticed that some of them only broke up furniture and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they were beating me when they were tearing my clothes off I felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her and what they did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later when they carried Karina off they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived but didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face with their fists kicking her using anything they could find. Mamma Karina and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain just didn't feel any no matter how much they beat me no matter what they did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested Let's take her outside. Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't afraid of what would happen to them. When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several times from the pain but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature but I'm vengeful especially if someone is mean to me and I don't deserve it. I hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me I'd remember them and I'll remember them for the rest of my life even though people tell me forget you have to forget you have to go on living. At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something and despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering to an end. I pushed one of them away he was a real horse. I remember now that he's being held too. As though they were all waiting for it they seized me and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair and it was stuck all over me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open and I realized that they planned to throw me out the window because they had already picked me up with their hands I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a really deep breath and closed my eyes and somehow braced myself inside I suddenly became cold as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream didn't beg them at all they became all the more wild like wolves. They started to trample me with their feet. Shoes with heels on them and iron horseshoes like they had spe- cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness. I came to a couple of times and waited for death summoned it beseeched it. Some people ask for good health life happiness but at that moment I didn't need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive and I had even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive it wasn't worth living. There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman pain and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to put an end to their pleasures and they pulled my hands from my throat. The person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then you see even during the investigation he almost called me daughter he apologized although of course he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior with my words or with my deeds I have always put myself in the other person's shoes but then in a matter of hours they trampled me entirely. I shall never forget it. I wanted to do myself in then because I had nothing to lose because no one could protect me. My father who tried to do something against that hoard of beasts by himself could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything. I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive. And Ira Melkumian my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't so he tried to kill her his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into the other room her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it was Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her and made her death even more excruciating maybe the most excruciating of all the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin he knows my family a little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku how we were feeling and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said You should praise

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan- ger was past and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas ornaments howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this went on. When we figured out the time later it turned out that I howled and was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into tears I started feeling sorry for myself and so on and so forth . . . Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I want to respond and restrain myself I think that I'm hallucinating. I am silent and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling me then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor the one whose apartment she was hiding in Uncle Sabir Kasumov to our place telling him I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse. He went and returned empty handed but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his apartment. She sent him another time and then sent his wife and they were walking through the rooms looking for me but I didn't answer their calls. There was no light they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps. They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock and at 9:30 I went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the apartment: how long can you wait for your own death how long can you be cowardly afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the doors one after the next. No one not on the fifth floor not on the fourth opened the door. On the third floor on the landing of the stairway Uncle Sabir's son started to shout Aunt Roza don't cry Lyuda's alive! He knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya Igor and after them Mamma. Aunt Tanya Uncle Sabir's wife is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their apartment. I didn't see Karina but she was in their home too Lying delirious she had a fever. Marina was there too and my father and mother. All of my family had gathered there. At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the apartment. Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said Lyuda Karina's in really serious condition she's probably dying. If she recognizes you don't cry don't tell her that her face looks so awful. It was as though her whole face was paralyzed you know everything was pushed over to one side her eye was all swollen and everything flowed together her lips her cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict that's how disfigured her face was. I said Fine. Mamma was afraid to go into the room because she went in and hugged Karina and started to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the bed hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye that was intact looked at me and said Who is it? But I could barely talk my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say but rather muttered something tender something incomprehensible but tender My Karochka my Karina my little golden one . . .  She understood me. Then Igor brought me some water I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. She started to groan. She was saying something to me but I couldn't understand it. Then I made out It hurts I hurt all over. Her hair was glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead her head she had grit on her forehead and on her lips . . . She was groaning again and I don't know how to help her. She calls me over with her hand come closer. I go to her. She's saying something to me but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil and paper and says Write it down. She shakes her head as if to say no I can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me something but she couldn't. I say Karina just lie there a little while then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then. And then she says Maybe it'll be too late. And I completely . . . just broke down I couldn't control myself. Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She says Lyuda we're not saved yet we have to go somewhere else. Out of this damned house. They want to kill us I know. They'll find us here too. We need to call Urshan. She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour Until I understood her every word. I ask What's his number? Urshan Feyruzovich that's the head of the administration where she works. We have to call him. But I didn't know his home number. I say Karina what's his number? She says I can't remember. I say Who knows his number? Who can I call? She says I don't know anything leave me alone. I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there he was crying too. I say Mamma Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can we call him? Who knows his telephone number? I tell Marina Think think who can we call to find out? She started calling; several people didn't answer. She called a girlfriend her girlfriend called another girlfriend and found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking I can't talk normally. She says Lyuda don't panic get a hold of yourself go out to those hooligans and tell them that they just can't do that. She still didn't know what was really going on. I said It's easy for you to say that you don't understand what's happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single Armenian left in the building they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised that we managed to save ourselves. She says Well OK if it's that serious . . .  And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up and that I'm fearing for my life that in fact it's not all that bad. OK fine fine she says if you're afraid OK as soon as Urshan comes back I'll send him over. We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly under Aunt Tanya's on the second floor Asya Dallakian's apartment. She wasn't home she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and finally we get through. She says Yes he's come home he's leaving for your place now. He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening either because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep with his two daughters like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has grown up daughters they're almost my age. The three of us carried out Karina tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf and went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move we might have fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor bandaged on the concrete floor groaning . . . This was around eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers enemies . . . everything just like a war. They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle Arkady I think because someone said Arkady get an injection ready he started to fill a syringe and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man in his sixties his hair was all grey and his moustache too. He hugged Karina and started to cry: What have they done to you?! He was speaking Armenian. What have they done to you?! Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then and she started to cry too. The man tried to calm her. I'll give you a shot. Mamma tells him I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people and you're just sitting here! Some teacups were standing on the table in there. You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my daughters! Look what they've turned them into! They gave her something to drink some heart medicine I think. They gave Karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa and Urshan I think even though Papa was in bad shape helped carry Karina out. When they put her on the stretcher none of the medics got near her. I don't know maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: What's the matter with you? Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on too an orange one Aunt Tanya's. I said I'm fine. Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me and then told the doctor You leave let a woman examine her. A woman came an Azerbaijani I believe and said What's wrong with you? I was wearing my sister Lyuda's nightshirt the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge wound about the size of a hand on my back from the Indian vase. She said something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be dressed with something but that they'd do that in the hospital. They put me on a stretcher too. They started looking for people to carry me. I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up and this woman I don't know if she was a doctor or a nurse said Lie still you mustn't move. When I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed very familiar to me. I shouted Stop! One of the policemen turned and says What do you want? I say Bring him to me I want to look at him. They brought him over and I said That person was just in our apartment and he just raped me and my sister. I recognize him note it down. They said Fine but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were taking him. Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me Sister . . .  I don't remember the conversation exactly but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us. I asked him Where are you from? He said that he was from Ufa. Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I learned that they suffered most of all. He says OK you're Armenians they didn't get along with you but I'm a Russian he says what are they trying to kill me for? Oh I remembered something else. When I went out onto the balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed against the fence and he covered his head with his arms they were beating him with his own club. The way he cried Mamma made my skin crawl. I don't know what they did to him if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before he attack on our house we saw sheets clothes and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building but I didn't think it was Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didn't need out or someone was fighting with someone. It was only later when they were burning a passenger car in the yard when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians that I realized that this was serious that it was anti-Armenian. They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too and said I've been beaten too help me. But they just ignored her. My father went to them and said in a guilty voice as though it was his fault that he'd been beaten and says My ribs hurt so much those creeps have probably broken my ribs. Please look at them. The doctor says That's not my job. Urshan said Fine I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them to his apartment. Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us but I was very surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the Hippocrat
2,Dear folks I am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment. It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights. It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country Palestine. Gaza is not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv Jaffa Askalon BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it. It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves there will be hope for peace. Not before. Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical but that of a master and slave the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading. To close off 700000 people in the Strip deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss to which Israeli society has degraded. I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ? Please give an honest answer. Elias

Even if it's true (and in this case I'd take it without asking you to prove it) it is still far from killing reporters.  Also whenever that happened I'll bet it happened as individual actions by certain soldiers and not as a policy of the government  (e.g. see the Hawara case where a colonel was sentenced for giving orders to kick Arabs  as far as I remember).

2,I really don't know how you can possibly maintain this hypocritical stance. On the one hand you imply that there is a conspiracy of Arab-Americans that warrants the illegal gathering of information on them (ie. auto license/ registration information in California) and other forms of monitoring including blatant attempts by paid ADL agents to discredit an American-Arab organization by trying to distribute Nazi propaganda.  Furthermore you attempt to rationalize this through crude stereotyping by pointing to the WTC bombing in which Arab-Americans had no involvement. On the other hand you publish this excerpt which seems to rail against notions of a racial (Jewish in this case) conspiracy and stereotypes.

The Hirgun and other branch - off militant groups did fight the British do get them out of Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British soldiers but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in favor of a compromise with the Palestinians. The Irgun killed SOLDIERS  which is a legitimate way to drive an unwanted fogriend regime from a country.  They didn't kill blindly their families or such (not as a policy  I agree that brits which were not soldiers also were killed sometimes) nor they killed Arabs just for being Arabs. In case I have to remind you the difference  the majority of the attacks of the Arab terrorist organizations was on civilians.  They even tried to justify their attacks by saying that all Jews in the Israel served in the army at one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets. In addition they massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948 contributing to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their very lives. Yes these exceptions were tragic mistakes.  I wasn't there and don't have reffereces handy but from what I heard your description is a bit carried away most of the vilagers fled with several dozens  most of them claimed to be fighters being killed. Those massaceres are far from being the rule considering that dozens if not hounders of Arab vilages came under Israeli rule during the same time period. I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the Jews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for German and European anti semitism.

Look up the facts first post second.  Bernadotte was assassinated in September 1948 by Lehi under the orders of its three commanders (one of whom was Yitzhak Shamir).  There is no hard evidence of complicity of the Israeli government despite some effort by the UN and other organizations (US intelligence Swedish government) to find it.  However a great fuss was made over the apparent lack of zeal of the Israeli government to track down the killers.  The Lehi man who actually pulled the trigger later became a personal friend of David Ben-Gurion.  The best published account in English is A.

2,The honest answer to your question about Arabs who were expelled from Jaffa and/or who fled Jaffa or anywhere else in Israel having the right to return is:  Yes unfortunately they have the right to return.  They may apply for citizenship like any other non-Israeli and then go to >Jaffa and try to buy their house back from the Jews who now own it. And now a question and answer for you:  Can the Jews who were born and raised in Hebron or their descendants go back to THEIR homes in Hebron?  The answer is: absolutely NOT because they were almost all murdered by their Arab neighbors - the palestinians. Now do I think the Arabs should be allowed to even visit their homes in Jaffa?  Hell no.  Bring back the Jews of Hebron Petah Tikva Jerusalem Safed etc. Then perhaps I would be in favor of Arabs returning to their Jaffa homes.  However seeing as no Arab has yet been able to bring people back from the dead I'd say that's out. With all the hope in the world Nissan Ratzlav-Katz nraclaw@jade.tufts.edu

First of all even if you identify yourself as completely Jewish that doesn't rule out the possibility that you're a self-hating anti-semite.  One can always find Jews who are uncomfortable with their identities (since they only want Jews to be cowering victims) and are willing to speak up for their enemies.  Secondly the strength or weakness of your arguments does not depend on your identity. -Adam Schwartz (not affraid to sign my name).
2,Center for Policy Research <cpr@igc.apc.org> writes: Here you give positive accurate facts about what happened to the beduins and the land: After the creation of the State of Israel 80 percent of the Negev Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The 10000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev spring of life in the desert were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming. A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev. But after 1982 when the Sinai was returned to Egypt these Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army. And now you say noone knows anything about what happened there: No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of the 40000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities. Indeed most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven development towns or *sowetos* established for them. (the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson email: elias@ismennt.is) So what you basically say is that we know for sure that nothing good happens there now  we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived and that they were driven away by the Jews  noone on earth knows about what the Jews did there. Is that what you said?  Could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote? BTW  try asking beduins in Sinai how they mis the Israelis.  Not to mention that there are enough valotaring beduins in the IDF to have at least one full brigade of them. -- --Amos Shapira (Jumper Extraordinaire) |  It is true that power corrupts C.S.

Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on the part of the Jews and a massacre defines it best in my opinion.  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the Jews a peace pact but the Irgun purposely broke this agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians.  I might grant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] but nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun.  The Deir Yassin MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland....and contrary to your belief many civilians were killed.  Deir Yassin was later advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was useful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinians were rightfully scared off because they did not want another Deir Yassin. I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here; atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs. Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are and were the good guys in the middle east.  Both Arab and Jew suck equally. rj3s you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the Irgun to attack Dir Yassin was its strategic importance. In fact Begin who was in charge of the Irgun wrote that Dir Yassin was attacked for its military significance. Dir Yassin was merely a battle in the War of Liberation. People died. But the thing was never intended to be a masacre. That this hapenned is a tragedy of war - not a crime of the Irgun. Harry.

I would view it as if the historical destiny of my generation Dor Tashach the generation that had the great privilege of determining the fate of the people and founding the Jewish state had been lost.

2,From Israeline 4/27/93 Peace Talks Resume Today; Israel to Offer Palestinians New Proposals Israel Radio KOL YISRAEL reports on today's resumption in Washington of the bilateral peace talks following a recess which lasted over four months. According to the report Israel is expected to offer the Palestinians new proposals regarding the authority of the Palestinian Executive Council general elections control over land and human rights issues in the Territories. Israel will express its readiness to give the Palestinians control of more land than previously offered. According to the radio report one estimate is that Israel will give the Palestinians control over as much as two thirds of the administered lands as well as broad authority on water issues. Israel will seek to promote its offer to hold elections in the Territories in hopes of strengthening the position of the Palestinian delegation to the peace negotiations. According to Israel Radio the Israeli delegation to the bilateral talks with the Palestinians will offer greater responsibilities to the Palestinian Executive Council allowing it certain legislative capabilities without making it a symbol for Palestinian sovereignty. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher invited all the heads of delegations to a gathering tonight. It will be the first such event since the Madrid conference. Head of the American team at the bilateral peace talks Edward Djerejian said that tonight's gathering is meant to demonstrate the U.S.' active role in the peace process. --- Naftaly Stramer 			 | Intergraph Electronics Internet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road Suite A Voice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder CO 80301 Quality is everybody's job and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can.

2,A few things about the University. It is more fun than some may admit. Partying does go on and it has consistently been ranked one of Playboy's top party schools. But we do study and more importantly learn a lot. The overall UVa drug use is actually lower than the average college in the U.S. There is no hate law on the books even though they (The forces of PC) tried to have one last year( by the way a similar law at the University of Wisconsin ? was found unconstitutional last year). There is a law against relationship of professors with their students or advisees that just passed. Thomas Jefferson was the sole author of the Virginia statute for religious freedom(the basis for the first ten amendments) though he is not given full credit for righting the bill of rights. So someone who picked on me for that is right. By the way we're the man in everything. Sports academics and partying. I'm sure a lot of other schools are good at what they do as well so don't start mailing me junk. I'm happy where I am and maybe I'll go to one of y'alls medical schools in a couple of years.
2,It is all so changed by now. but in case any of you is interested in what I actually said I never compared the Israeli treatment of the palestinians with the Holocaust. Anyway that is the truth if it matters. I was about to forget about it myself since everyone started calling me anti-semitic for making the comparison that I never made. What I did say was that the Nazis didn't start with the Holocaust and their initial actions were similar to what the Israelis are doing now. The Jews that were stranded on the polish border since no country accepted them are like the arabs stranded on the lebenese border. No trials no hearing just expulsion based on guilt due to race.

I think the answer to Mr. Mayamsky's question can be found in the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(Mr. Mamaysky's) first amendment to the US Constitution. Amendment I                                           (1791) Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. Steve I do not say that freedom of speech should be banned. Far from it. I am merely suggesting that there are certain things which can be universally agreed to be morally incorrect. There are not many such things. But there are some. As an example: (1) murder is morally incorrect (2) the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior to another is morally incorrect etc. The point is that any action which serves to promote a morally incorrect action should be forbidden. This implies that no one has the right to say that an innocent person should be murdered. Regardless of freedom of speech I may not stand on a street corner and advocate the murder of innocent people. The reason for this is that murder is a morally incorrect action. In the same way since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrow definition which we have given it (2) I nor any one else has the right to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry. Such an enforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed by the first amendment. It merely ensures that no person may be the target of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right such as the right to not be murdered and the right not to be discriminated against. I believe Mr. Berson that to blindly accept the constitution is a terrific mistake. We must cinstantly question the constitution and interpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live. Anything short of such an effort would render us little more than trained monkeys who are able to merely repeat what they have heard without paying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document in question. Would you disagree Mr.Berson? Harry.

The KKK is allowed to march and any attempts to curtail their freedom is rejected (Actually I believe the ACLU won a case for them last year). Morality should not be legilated in a free country like the U.S. Yes. That seems to be the problem. Even Germany now has laws for its military where soldiers are *required* to disobey orders if they believe the orders are morally incorrect. Naziism is prohibited in Canada Germany (others?).

2,There are basically three alternatives for Gaza: 1.  To throw the Jews to the sea. that is basically to make them leave the Middle-East and go back to where they came from (russia Europe USA etc) 2.  To throw the Gazans into the sea in accordance with Yitzhak Rabin's wish and that of many Zionists. 3.  For Israelis and Palestinians to come to an honorable and fair (I don't attempt to say just) settlement which would allow each person to live in dignity in his country in freedom and equality. I personnaly opt for the third alternative. How about you folks ? Elias
2,Found this in soc.culture.pakistan Might be of interest..... am posting it without the permission of the original poster. Hope he/she doesnt mind. By Lance Gay Scripps-Howard News Service SARAJEVO Bosnia-Herzegovina -- In this land of historic hatreds a tiny Jewish community is braving Serbian shells to repay a 50-year-old debt to Muslims who saved Jews from the Holocaust. Ivica Ceresnjes president of the Jewish Community of Sarajevo says he and about 1000 other Jews chose to remain in Sarajevo rather than leave for Israel to keep a feeding center in the medieval old town district running. Ceresnjes said that was partly in gratitude to the Muslims who hid Jews during the Nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuries-old presence of Jews living in Sarajevo. ``Some with guns are defending Bosnia but I fight in Bosnia by keeping people alive'' Ceresnjes said. As a student of Balkan history Ceresnjes said he saw this war coming and had ready plans to evacuate children and the elderly. A year before the war erupted here last April Ceresnjes said the Jewish center began stockpiling supplies ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for places in Israel and Europe for the evacuees. They were so well prepared he said that only five days after the shooting began the first plane left. Of about 2000 Jews in Bosnia- Herzegovina he estimates half have left. Many of those who stayed behind work in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue which has been turned into a wartime feeding center that has so far given away 380000 meals. The center which has been shelled several times along with most of Sarajevo also runs a radio station mail center and distributes food packages sent by Jewish organizations around the world. While Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast Jews here say there's a long tradition of cooperation inter-marriage and tolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to centuries of Turkish occupation. Sarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman Catholic Spain in 1492. The community numbered more than 14000 before World War II. But only 10% survived the Holocaust -- which was carried out by the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia. Many of the survivors were hidden by Muslim families in Mostar. -- Sharon Machlis Gartenberg Framingham MA  USA e-mail: sharon@world.std.com ---------------------------------------- Zafar. tippu hassan

Certainly the PLO did shell Northern [BH] Israel from the Arqoub region but Israel did much more shelling [BH] destroying several South Lebanese villages.  At the very least [BH] we can say that both sides exchanged shelling with occasional [BH] aerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages. [BH] In any case Steve's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in [BH] response to years of shelling from Lebanon is false.  Israel had [BH] many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government [BH] in Lebanon favorable to Israel and it nearly achieved this aim [BH] with the election of Basheer El Gemayel and his brother Amin [BH] El Gemayel but the internal situation in Lebanon was too hard [BH] to control and predict so Israel had to withdraw and Amin El Gemayel [BH] had to abrogate the 17 th of May Agreement. Basil I was only correcting Steve's statement that Geurillas were shelling Israel from the Golan which was absurd. The fact that Israel did much more shelling was in response to Palestinian shelling from Lebanon. Israel has no intention of keeping an inch of Lebanese territory. Israel will continue to fight Hizbullah PLO FPLP etc. as long as its northern border is not quiet. If the Lebanese army can control these elements then I think we can see genuine peace on the Israel-Lebanese border. I remind you that a couple thousand Lebanese cross each day into Israel to work. As for the election of Bashir Gemayel it is true that he was favorable to Israel is that why the Syrians killed him? His brother Amin was a Syrian puppet if he had not been he would have been dead by now.

I wish that people (including myself) would have more objective views like Tim Basil and Shai for example and put the rhetoric aside and start discussing substance. My view is that Israel has made more gestures towards its Arab foes than the opposite. What have the Sysrians given to us or proposed? What have the Palestinians proposed? If the Palestinians would just revoke or rewrite their charter or just condemn acts of Palestinian violence that would be a good start. The Palestinians have all to gain from these negotiations. Its seems though that they are not strong enough to make decisions on their own and are plagued by internal strife that is why we are not getting anywhere. Fundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories then it will be too late to discuss issues with the Palestinians since they will only vow for the destruction of Israel. Arabs  must take example on Egypt. Egypt came to the bargaining table got what it wanted from Israel and there is now peace and cooperation between the two countries.

Coming from a self-exposed historical revisionist a self-admitted anti-Muslim and a genocide apologist Hamaza should take your drivel as a compliment. Furthermore you even deny the obvious. There was a genocide of the Muslims carried out by order of the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government. Massacres of Muslims must be studied in detail because they are the first modern example of the horrible crime of genocide. Blame must be apportioned to the Armenians and their supporters for the murder of Muslims. The Turkish historic homeland emptied of its native population until today remains occupied by the x-Soviet Armenian Government. Today x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds. The following are the Jewish and Armenian sources on the cold-blooded genocide perpetrated by the x-Soviet Armenian Government against 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920. Still denying the obvious? Source: Stanford J.

In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city of Van whose 33789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan on April 28 1915 Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days. Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves. With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.

Let with Your will great Majesty the peoples remaining under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new free life under the protection of Russia.'[155] Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies. Preparations were made to strike the Ottomans from the rear and the czar returned to St. Petersburg confident that the day finally had come for him to reach Istanbul.

An Armenian state was organized at Van under Russian protection and it appeared that with the Muslim natives dead or driven away it might be able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient Armenian civilization. An Armenian legion was organized 'to expel the Turks from the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet.'[162] Thousands of Armenians from Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new Armenian state...By mid-July there were as many as 250000 Armenians crowded into the Van area which before the crisis had housed and fed no more than 50000 people Muslim and non-Muslim alike.[163] [162] Hovannisian Road to Independence p. 56; FOP 2488 nos. 127223 and 58350.

The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4700000 of whom 940000 (20 percent) were Armenian 1200000 (25 percent) Georgian and 2220000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group 1140000 were Tatars. Paradoxically barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd the administrative center of the province had only 44000 Armenians as compared to 68000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897 however the Armenians had established a scant majority 53 percent in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent or 670000 of the 1120000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic a solid block of 370000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia. (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of Transcaucasia). In 1920 '0' percent Turk. We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead. Ohanus Appressian Men Are Like That p. 202. An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic.

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920 the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1000 year homeland. The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

History shows that within the last 170 years Greeks played that game twice: They used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in 1822 to instigate the Morea rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the Muslim people.

In the words of Professor Skiotis With savage jubilance [the Greeks] sang the words 'Let no Turk remain in the Morea nor in the whole world.' The Greeks were determined to achieve to 'Romaiko' in the only way they knew how: through a war of religious extermination. Let me further improve this one for you. After the Ottoman Empire lost World War I the British landed in 1919 a 200000 Greek army in Izmir to exterminate the people of Turkiye. Are you suffering from a severe case of amnesia?

The success of the Greek national movement provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the efforts of the Greeks themselves stimulated similar uprisings among the other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed not so much by the Ottomans but rather by the Greek religious hierarchy which dominated the Orthodox millet leading first to pressure for religious independence granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870 to the Serbian Church in 1879 and to the Rumanian Church in 1885 with subsequent aspirations for and achievement of political independence following...>> page 188: <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian missionaries who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence. Christian nationalism based as much on religious as on ethnic identity soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past. Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed involving large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies by the independent states that resulted also by Christian subjects who remained within the Empire particularly because of Jewish and Muslim support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive and damaging. The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting nationalists and later successfully established independent Christian states committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout the nineteenth century despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878)...>> page 188: <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and massacred and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries earlier. This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth century with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead as united Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia Peter the Lame banished its Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants.

When the Greek nationalist movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia during the spring of 1821 hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During the height of the Greek revolution five thousand Jews were massacred in Morea along with most of the Muslim population numbering about twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1200 Jews were massacred along with uncounted Turks [16].  Reverend John Hartley after describing the carnage concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood mingled with Turkish flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac and the sons of Ishmael on this as well as on every occasion during the Greek Revolution met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the city and like the ancient sovereign of Judah they received no burial superior to that of an ass.' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of Sparta Patras Corinthos Mistra and Argos were wiped out by bands of Greek rebels along with those of Thebes Vrachori Attica and Epirus [18]. The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu where Jews who had fled from Italy and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century though divided into rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long however before it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution leading to savage repression and massacres of Jews forcing the surviving members of the two communities to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years of Greek revolution Greek nationalists went from town to town on the mainland and from island to island in the Agean exterminating all the Jews and Muslims they could find many along the roads as they desperately fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats to Izmir thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica were the Jews and the Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults thus saving their populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th century particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897 those Jews who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens Chalkis Larissa Corfu and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre forcing thousands more to emigrate into Ottoman territory particularly to Salonica and Izmir [21].>> page 193 (last paragraph): <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all the countries involved with blood-libel accusations once again being used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers merchants and professionals a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the Turks both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their homes and shops taken over without compensation while the survivors fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews little was done in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the twentieth century.>> page 194 (last paragraph): <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884 and again in 1892 and 1903 thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from persecution in Vidin in independent Bulgaria. The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13) including Salonica Corlu and Edirne was followed by general attacks on Jews their synagogues homes and shops in both countries [27] resulting in a renewed exodus toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically described the situation caused by the invading armies: 'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth can never destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. The consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims but sixty of them were massacred in a single night....'[28] 'It wasn't only irregulars (Comitacis) who massacred pillaged and burned. The soldiers of the Army the Chief of Police and the high civil officials took an active part in the events at Serres. Out of 6000 houses 4000 were burned. Almost 1200 shops were consumed by flames and destructive bombs. The (Jewish) population lost all and without even anything to wear is in despair. Everyone wants to emigrate...'[29] page 196: <<As a result of these assaults massacres and forced deportations from the independent countries of Southeastern Europe the Ottoman Empire received literally thousands of Jewish refugees who joined the Muslims who survived the persecution flooding into the Empire...>> [14] Shlomo Rozanes Korot Hayehudim Beturkiyah Vebeartzot Hakedem: Hadorot Haachronim (Jerusalem 1945) pp.42-44 cited Yitzchak Kerem 'The Influence of Anti-Semitism on Jewish Immigration Patterns from Greece to the Ottoman Empire in the 19th Century' pp.2 14.

Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government will not get away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds and 204000 Azeri people. Your criminal grandparents committed unheard-of crimes resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism organized massacres poured petrol over babies and burned them raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. And today they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history. Your fascist grandparents admitted their unspeakable crimes then. Why deny them now? Now the genocide of the truth by the criminal/Nazi Armenians? Not a chance. Source: Men Are Like That by Leonard Ramsden Hartill. The Bobbs-Merrill Company Indianapolis (1926). (305 pages). (Memoirs of an Armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people) Foreword: For example we were camped one night in a half-ruined Tartar mosque the most habitable building of a destroyed village near the border of Persia and Russian Armenia. During the course of evening I asked Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied Yes I assisted in its sack and destruction and witnessed the slaying of those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins. p. 202 (first and second paragraphs). We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead. p. 15 (second paragraph). The Tartars were for the most part poor. Some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley from plain to mountain and from mountain to plain following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. Even the village Tartars are a primitive people only semicivilized. I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars and while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country regarded and treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility. p. 20 (second paragraph). Our men armed themselves gathered together and advanced on the Tartar section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear. Our men hammered on the doors but got no response; whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night I cowered at home in terror unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished. p. 109 (second paragraph). As things were the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means. The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law. When they became a legally instituted recognized governing body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days. The outstanding feature of their rule now that they were in power was as in the old days trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts. p. 203 (first paragraph). A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body and raising it to his lips licked it clean of blood exclaiming in Russian 'Slodkey! Slodkey!' (Sweet.) p. 203 (second paragraph). One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls mere children. The girls were crouched on the ground crying softly with suppressed sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the dead. p. 204 (first paragraph). I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying I entered the yard of a house which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child a girl about a year old. p. 118. Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow the cart jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen encouraging them with shrill Tartar cries and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the carts the women veiled as is the Tartar way held children in their arms. Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot. Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts screamed ran and sought vainly for safety. This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by barracks hearing the firing and the turmoil hurried to the scene.... That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed. p. 192. Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the Turks. p. 193. Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars Kurds and Turks. Their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country. p. 195. The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity: Tartars Kurds and Russians. p. 218. (First and second paragraphs) Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in the slaughtering of prisoners the looting and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace actions expected and accepted as a matter of course. I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground in numbers like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle fired with ardor and courage with weapons in their hands and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself. p. 133 (first paragraph) In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the brutality displayed but could not make any effective protest. Some mercifully were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut and then after crowding the hut with Turks set fire to the straw. p. 19 (first paragraph) The Tartar section of the town no longer existed except as a pile of ruins. It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. The same fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi. p. 22 (second paragraph) Many of our men had served in the Russian Army and were trained soldiers. We Armenians were rich and possessed arms. Tartars had never received military training. They were poor and possessed few arms beyond knives. ...Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village the revolution in Russia was suppressed. p. 97 (third paragraph) Within a few years following the beginning of the movement an invisible government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government. This secret government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called 'Mauserists' (professional killers) to enforce its decrees. p. 98 (first paragraph) The Dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the Turkish Government. p. 98 (third paragraph) ...the Dashnacks engineered a general revolt of Armenians in Turkish Armenia under the mistaken belief that European nations would intervene and secure independence for Turkish Armenia. p. 99 (second paragraph) The Dashnacks were fanatics. p. 99 (third paragraph) The Dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their revolutionary activities into the Russian province. They instituted a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing contributions to the party funds from rich Armenians. A wealthy man would be assessed a stipulated sum. Refusal to pay brought upon him a sentence of death. Every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without question. If a man were to be assassinated lots might be drawn to select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the 'mauserists' of the party. p. 130 (first paragraph) ...in moments of victory against Turks and Kurds or Tartars they [Armenians] have been remorseless in seeking vengeance. p. 130 (third paragraph) The city was a scene of confusion and terror. During the early days of the war when the Russian troops invaded Turkey large numbers of the Turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the Russian advance. p. 159 (second paragraph) I made a cannon a huge gun to lift which required four men. I made balls for it. With my cannon the Armenians could knock down any of the Tartar houses and so they were able to drive the Tartars out. p. 181 (first paragraph) The Tartar villages were in ruins. p. 189 (third paragraph) The dead Tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood his beard still setaceous and now crimsoned.

No they killed soldiers so that the British government would leave.  The objective was not to scare civilains but show that the cost of staying was way too high. In contrast a terrorist kills civilains to scare other civilains.  They use random violence against people to make a point that no one is safe until their demands are met.  An analogy would be the Irgun blowing up Harrods or 10 Downing. >  Sounds like a form of terrorism to me and not much removed from >Arab terrorism. Thats because you missed the essential point of arab terrorism which is to scare civilains away from Israel by killing those who have something to do with Israel.  It is to kill Jews because they might be Zionists.  It is to kill people who live in Israel because of where they live.  The targets are rarely soldiers or other people who understand they might be attacked in the line of duty but innocent civilians to underscore the message that no one who deals with Israel is safe. >	I'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy but >I'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they >were a bit screwed.

I have no idea what this guy means but the Syrian Jews are not allowed to leave Syria because Assad welshed on his promise and is not letting them go. Israel has nothing to do with it. As for the other Arab countries there are still small communities left in some Arab countries. Morocco has the largest group I think comprising perhaps just over a thousand (but I have lost the exact figure. Maybe someone will be so kind as to post it). There are communities left in Yemen (which went to the polls yesterday in what might appear to be a free-ish election) Algeria (this is a tiny group a couple of leftist intellectuals I think) of course Syria and Lebannon. The circumstances of the departure of the Jews from various Arab countries is controversial in some cases - like Iraq - and I do not want to get into a dispute about it. Egypt expelled most of its community outright. Most of the French North African Jews left rather than face Independence. I think that Moroccans might have been encouraged by some AntiSemitic acts but I am not sure. Someone else around here will know for sure. There are claims that Israeli intellegence officers spread rumours around Algeria that the Jews would not be welcome but this is probably just propaganda. It would take a very stupid person not to realise the benefits of a move to France (as most did) or to Israel. Yemeni Jews were airlifted to Israel. Those left were rumoured to have another airlift last year but I heard nothing about it so I guess it was just a rumour. Any I left out except Iraq?

Congradulations tim. I think the other people answered you on most of the factual parts(esp. about the internal conflicts policy). Israel very often gets away with more than most other nations (Due to U.S. vetos). While I am not familiar with every instance I know that the reason Saudi Arabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the pilgrims were iranian. Yes the UN is biased but mostly in favor of the US and its allies (Including Israel Saudi Arabia and Pakistan) and against Outlaw countries like iran and more recently Iraq. Far be it from me to support the repressive governments there but I think they get more slack than Israel for things they do wrong. Again the reason some condemnations don't occur lies in the race or country of the victims. The gassed Iraqi kurds got associated with Iran in the war and since Iran was perceived as worse than Iraq no condemnation resulted. The palestinians killed by arab countries involved another case of who cares. It seems that until very recently no one cared about how many palestinians died anywhere (including in Israel and the occupied territories). Again I appreciate the lack of personal insults.
2,In the following report: _Turkey Eyes Regional Role_ ANKARA Turkey (AP) April 27 1993 we find in the last paragraph: [Turanist] Although Premier Suleyman Demirel criticized Ozal's often [Turanist] brash calls for more Turkish influence he also has spoken [Turanist] of a swath of Turkic peoples stretching from the Adriatic [Turanist] Sea to the Great Wall of China. Who does Demirel think he is fooling? It seems at both ends of his envisioned pan-Turkic Empire -- the Balkans and the Caucasus -- Turkey's fascist boasts are being pre-empted. I would suggest Turkey let the world feel some of their Grey Wolf Teeth and attempt to stretch from the Adriatic to China!

The conditions were wonderful thanks to our Armenians who received us. But it's not relaxing all the same. I don't know how everyone else feels about it but for me it's torture. We don't have a place to call our own. I had a two bedroom apartment in Sumgait my children went to school and we lived well in friendship. It's painful that in our times in 1988 in the Soviet period people can break into our apartment and try to kill me and my children in whom I've put all my efforts and my whole youth. Everything was going well for us: my older daughter was studying at the Institute the middle one was preparing to enter medical school and was interning as an orderly and my youngest had been sick for a long time but had returned to health. I have been though a lot in my life: it's been seven years since I lost my husband I raised my children by myself. Lots of women have similar fates but there's nothing to be done about it. But I can't control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on February 27 28 and 29 it was just a horror it's indescribable. On February 27 our relative Ira came to visit us. She's better friends with my oldest daughter and so right away she asked Where's Vika? I say Vika's off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days she's supposed to come back tomorrow. My middle daughter Gaya had baked a cake and we sat there talking and laughing drinking tea. Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira home. They left and a few minutes went by; suddenly I hear noise. I raced out to the balcony--our balcony is right across from the bus station we live at the corner of Mir and Druzhba Streets--I look and see that there are hoards of people near the bus station and they're all shouting something. What they're shouting I can't understand. Our neighbor is standing on his balcony too. I ask Nufar what's happened? He says I don't know I can't figure it out either. I got scared--the kids had gone outside and I wanted to run after them but then there was a knock at the door. I open the door and it's the kids. Mamma says Gayane you'll never believe what's going on out there! It's awful! Ira says Aunt Zina they're shouting 'Karabagh! Karabagh! Karabagh is ours!' We didn't know what was going on. They're threatening to drive out the Armenians and slaughter them. I called my brother and his wife answered the phone. I said Aunt Tamara don't worry Ira is staying here with us and we'll see her home later. I couldn't shut my eyes all night long even until morning. I was worried about Vika. My God what was going on what had happened?! -Gayane: That day on the 27th we stood on the balcony and observed what was happening although Mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of it. There weren't 50 yards between our building and the bus station. We could see and hear everything perfectly. They were stopping buses dragging people out leading all the passengers out looking for Armenians. If they found an Armenian on the bus then it started . . .I don't know what to call it . . . -Zinaida: It's called slaughter. -Gayane: The mob would descend on people and beat them. I don't know if they were killing them or not but when they left them they lay still not moving as though nothing was left of them. One person was lying there and they started dragging him. The police were standing right there to the side not doing anything they didn't take any steps to calm that mob. It was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony. And you couldn't go anywhere somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everything so as to tell of it later. We wanted to leave Sumgait that day. What kept us was the idea that we live in the Soviet Union and that something would be done about it. Where in the world was our government?! -Zinaida: We couldn't leave town of course because our older daughter wasn't home. And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana. On Sunday morning when I went to see Ira home our neighbor said Zin' you know they went into Valodya's house and smashed everything he had. They murdered his father and two sons. Valodya is our neighbor he's an Armenian he lives on the first floor. I think my God what is happening?! And in broad daylight! I saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting Slay the Armenians! Karabagh is ours! This was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. On the way I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says They beat our store manager they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him but he was an Azerbaijani. And I asked Did they kill him? She says No he's in serious condition. I left there and started to walk home on that same street but the mob started moving in my direction. I turned off the street and went down the little way that goes toward the Sputnik store. There I met another crowd but these weren't bandits these were our people from Sumgait. I was so frightened that I walked without knowing where was going I couldn't feel my legs or the ground under my feet. I was walking and there was a boy standing before my eyes. This was on the 27th around evening time. He ran under our balcony and the mob surged toward him shouting He's an Armenian get him! He wore a black coat. They grabbed him that boy near the bus stop I saw it. They grabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt. I made it home but I just couldn't calm down. My oldest daughter was in my thoughts. I was thinking my daughter's coming home now they'll stop her bus and she'll be gone. There's no police no protection nothing. It's like they had all died there's no one nothing no authorities whatsoever. I can't even find the words for it! I look and see an Ikarus arriving. Before going to the bus station they stop near our place across from the Kosmos movie theater. So this Ikarus stops  there and the gang is yelling the Azerbaijanis are running toward it yelling Armenians out! And I see them take the Armenians and beat them killing them. I can't watch it any more. It was a nightmare. I just couldn't watch it. But Gaya was standing there watching it and I scolded her. She says Mamma I have to see it I have to know what's happening I have to see it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it later. So our children will know. Gayane: We saw a great deal on the 27th. They caught no less than 20 people before my eyes. I can't say for sure if they killed them or not . . . -Zinaida: There were too many people there the mob was too big. You couldn't make anything out. But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes. He was 18 or 19 years old. -Gayane: I think he was older probably about 22. A tall fellow a big guy in a coat. He was walking quickly but when they shouted that he was an Armenian he tore off running. And the mob went after him. They caught him right under our balcony. I don't know. I don't think there could have been much left of him after that. You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks one person. It was a mob big angry and featureless. You know there was a similarity in the way they were dressed mostly they were wearing long black coats. You couldn't even tell them apart they were all wearing black and they all looked alike. -Zinaida: When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and he cried Mamma! I ran into the room. I couldn't watch any longer. An awful lot was going on right then in various places it wasn't only that boy several people were being beaten up. You couldn't see all of it at once but when that boy cried Mamma! I immediately started watching only him. -Gayane: On that first day it went on from about six in the morning until twelve at night. At midnight they dispersed and the police took their place. They were scattered about in all districts. But how can you explain the fact that by morning when it had already started getting light around seven o'clock our police were gone? The police disappeared and yielded their positions to the bandits. In the morning they started gathering at our inter- section again at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown. From morning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered and by nine o'clock you couldn't even see the ground. There were thousands of people in the crowd. Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians. -Zinaida: They had signals. I realized that when I noticed that they made a cross with their arms they crossed their arms over their heads. The cross evidently meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it. They let the Azerbaijani cars through and they stopped the Armenian ones and started their pogrom. -Gayane: They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his nationality was. He got out and said they were from Baku. But what is your nationality? He says Armenian. They immediately start shouting Ermeni Ermeni! And he says What's going on? I'm coming from Baku. I don't live in Sumgait. Doesn't matter who cares if you're from Baku or Sumgait. Anyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him and they dragged a woman--his wife probably--out of the car. At this point the police came and took the two and led them away. Then the mob started smashing the car and then burned it. The flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire! Then everyone ran away they thought the car was going to explode. About 20 minutes later another car comes along a green Moskvich. They ran up shouting Ermeni! Ermeni! But this time they didn't pull the people out of the car they didn't beat them. Maybe they burned them along with the car because no one emerged from the flames. The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too acquaintances of his walked by below and he asked them and they said Yes they burned them along with the car. About two hours later a whole wedding procession came by and there was a doll on the first car. We thought they were Armenians but the cars started to honk loudly. They were Azerbaijanis and they were immediately allowed through. -Zinaida: The driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way.' The whole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely. -Gayane: By the way at the marriage hall which is right in the courtyard of our building there was a wedding that day. The Azerbaijanis were cele- brating and dancing. On the streets there was grief and death people were being killed and people were celebrating the whole time. -Zinaida: Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and find out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive. She went to her girlfriend's in the building she lives in the first entryway on the third floor. Gaya came back and said Mamma the bus is supposed to come around eight after eight. You can imagine what I was feeling how hard it was: Vika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death. Then I heard shouting. I raced to the window and see that the belongings of our neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors. They were thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow. I started to cry. I am walking around the room crying wailing: Vika's not here what will come of her . . . Gaya of course was consoling me: Mamma nothing will happen to her don't worry calm down she's in good company they'll look out for her. Diana: I saw the green car burn. The car was burning when we went out onto the balcony. Gaya pushed me away telling me to get off the balcony. I left. Then they came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians here. -Zinaida: You're right I forgot about that that was on the 27th. Diana: There's a small grassy area in front of our balcony; there are trees planted there. The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the building. All the neighbors said no there are no Armenians here. There weren't a lot of Armenians in our building but there weren't just a few Armenian families either. -Gayane: They fell upon the apartments on the 28th. There were terribly many of them. Our courtyard is huge and it was completely filled with them. -Zinaida: Katusev had made an appearance on television earlier. He said that two people Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabagh. And when he said that . . . you know how bees sound have you heard how they buzz? It was like the buzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our courtyard howling and shouting. I don't know how to describe it. By this point we were afraid to watch from the balcony but when I looked out of the bedroom window--the Znaniye Bookstore is down there and Armenians live on the second and fourth floors--I saw their things being thrown out the windows. I
2,So Mr. Salah is still claiming Stalin was a Jew? This thread began on SCA when he and another guy claimed both Stalin and Lenin were Jews. When I posted evidence from books and the Britannica showing they were Christians someone made the (correct) remark that Lenin's maternal grandfather was a Jew who converted to Christianity. To counter the fact that Stalin was a Christian who during his youth was trained to be a priest Mr. Salah wrote yes it says he was trained to be a priest but not for what religion! (BTW Stalin developed strong antisemitic feelings later in his life). Mr. Salah seems intent on trying to spread hate against Jews by posting antisemitic forgeries and trying to prove that certain notorious people were Jews even if they were not. -Danny Keren.

They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population. The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the redefinition of much land used in common as public land. The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed. No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice. |>	The government had a number of reasons for encouraging people |>to move across the green line.

Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land. Phill Hallam-Baker
2,I have read numerous posts over a period of several months by this anti-Israel fanatic hiding in the shadow of the respectable sounding name of the 'Center for Policy Research.'  Obviously it is no research center of any kind unless 'researching' published documents to find material to use against Israel makes it so. Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising in itself.  That is simply part of the propaganda process.  I was curious if anyone knew who this anti-Israel fanatic hiding behind his phoney 'research center' name is.  Is he an Arab?  Is he some typical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism?'  Is he some Jew who perhaps lived in Israel and just couldn't make it there and is now taking his failure out on Israel? Let's shed some light on this clown once and for all.  It will help put his nonsense in the proper perspective.  And the readers of this group who are more interested in fact than in anti-Israel hyperbola can ignore this junk.
2,NEWS YOU MAY HAVE MISSED APR 19 1993 Not because you were too busy but because Israelists in the US media spiked it. ................ THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip during the three-week-long closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the Jewish state Palestinian sources said on Sunday. The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for Palestinian activists during the closure which was imposed on the strip and occupied West Bank. Five days ago girls at the Al-Khansaa secondary said a group of naked soldiers taunted them yelling: ``Come and kiss me.'' When the girls fled the soldiers threw empty bottles at them. On Saturday a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school. The same day soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls backed them against a wall and put their arms around them. When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat him with the butts of their rifles. On Tuesday troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh a practising Moslem and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused the soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the beating. On Friday soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan 60 blindfolded him and his wife put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As the elderly couple danced the soldiers slipped away. The coupled continued dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening. The army said it was checking the reports. .................... ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper. Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter. ``Right now our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer'' said Father George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish. Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of Palestinian attacks against Jews. The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem their economic spiritual and cultural centre. Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation of requesting permits to reach holy sites. Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory allowing Jews free movement to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian celebrations. ``Yesterday we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption. But we cannot reach our holiest sites'' he said. An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech demanding to see his identity card before ordering the crowd to leave. ...................

The US has been running on debt for the past four generations and has still financed what it pleases. And after the Gulf War Israel could do whatever it wanted after not decimating Iraq after the Scud attacks.  It was encouraged but by no means forced to negotiate. Mr. Baker to address all of your points would be impossible but in a nutshell it is hypocritical for you to attack Israel's presence in Lebanon without attacking Syria.  Syrian occupation has been hostile and amounts to annexation.  Israel's is clearly defensive.  If it were not defensive you would see all of Lebanon occupied and governed by Israel.  But that is not what Israel wants. Pete

2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Unconventional peace proposal A unconventional proposal for peace in the Middle-East. ---------------------------------------------------------- by Elias Davidsson The following proposal is based on the following assumptions: 1.      Fundamental human rights such as the right to life to education to establish a family and have children to human dignity the right to free movement to free expression etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states. 2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities basic human rights should prevail. 3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab however labelled an unresolved conflict exists. 4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. It moreover poisons relations between communities peoples and nations. 5.      Each year the United States expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties. 6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional political means have failed. 7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land there is no just nor peaceful solution possible. 8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. When people love they share. Having stated my assumptions I will now state my proposal. 1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew and the other Palestinian-Arab. 2.      To be entitled for a grant a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner although born in areas under current Isreali control is not entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return. 3.      For the first child the grant will amount to $18.000. For the second the third child $12.000 for each child. For each subsequent child the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child. 4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict including the U.S. Government Jewish and Christian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of governments and international organizations. 5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the Middle-East in a graceful manner. Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will attempt to identify some of these: 1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage is not conventional. However it is based on the concept of affirmative action which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation. 2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice but Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above) 3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their point of view the continued existence of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration be it human love peace of human rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress Edgar Bronfman reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to Der Spiegel a German magazine. He called the increasing assimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity> comparable in its effects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above) 4.      It may objected that only a few people in Israel/Palestine would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal the existence of such a Fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes. 5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has merits. However it must be remembered that huge sums more than $3 billion are expended each year by the United States government and by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the Middle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land. I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment.

A genocide of Armenians took place during peacetime. And it was a great tragedy for me personally because I lost my father in those days. He was still young. Born in 1926. On that day February 28 we were at home. Of course we had heard that there was unrest in town my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we didn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors that they wouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home watching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir Street. This is right near downtown next to the airline ticket office our house is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields there. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the direction of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off the light. As it turns out their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the light. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We of course didn't know and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment. Suddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door all four of us: there were four of us in the apartment. Father Mother my younger brother Aleksandr and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot. We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder breaking it down with axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani What's going on? What's happened? They say Armenians get out of here! We don't open the door we say If we have to leave we'll leave we'll leave tomorrow. They say No leave now get out of here Armenian dogs get out of here! By now they've broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best we can my father and I on one side and my mother and brother on the other. We had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and when the door gave way we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We held the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side first with an axe and then with a crowbar. When the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them with the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes crowbars pipes and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father in the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the room one of them hit my mother too in the left part of her face. My brother Sasha and I fought back of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered he was the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands and we injured several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes all that went on. But they the injured ones fell back and others came to take their places there were many of them. The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door so as to go into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought skewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father bleeding: his face was covered with blood he had been wounded in the head and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall drove them down to the third floor. We came out on the landing but a group of the bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in there having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man an imposing man of about 40 an Azerbaijani came in. When he was coming in Father fell down and Mother flew to him and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and started calling an ambulance but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: What's with you woman why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that? She says What do you mean what happened? You killed somebody! My father was a musician he played the clarinet he played at many weddings Armenian and Azerbaijani he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings he brought so much joy to people and you killed that person. He says You don't need to shout stop shouting. And when they heard the voice of this man the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and started running out. We chased after them but they ran away. That man left too. As we were later told downstairs one of them told the others I don't know if it was from fright or what told them that we had firearms even though we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started to massage his heart but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to call an ambulance. The ambulance never came although we waited for it all evening and all through the night. Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were from Khachmas. They said We heard that a group was here at your place you have our condolences. They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay in the room. So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well we say if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy investigators. They say Leave everything just how it is we're coming back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything. Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too but no one helped us take Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times but no one came. We called an ambulance and nobody came. Then one of the neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and went up to the neighbor's. The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles ZIL panel trucks and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A crowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then in Buildings 19 and 20 that's next to the airline ticket office they started breaking into Armenian apartments destroying property and stealing. The Armenians weren't at home they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were some Armenians left on the fourth floor meaning us. They're up there still up there. Let's go kill them! They broke up all the furniture remaining in the two rooms threw it outside and burned it in large fires. We were hiding one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door shouting that it was probably Father they had thrown Father were defiling the corpse probably throwing it in the fire going to burn it. I heard it and the sound was kind of hollow and I said No that's from some of the furniture. Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow and calmed him down. The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also Armenians they had left for another city. The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said Are you crazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the apartments? They could kill you and them! And to us : . . . Come on leave this apartment! We went down to the third floor to some other neighbors'. At first the man didn't want to let us in but then one of his sons asked him and he relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound of motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the other rooms as we found out later all the chandeliers had been torn down. They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning which probably was a signal they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our Microdistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom. With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were saved. Our salvation--my mother's my brother's and mine--was purely accidental because as we later found out from the neighbors someone in the crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well we fought but we were only able to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on the bandits some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We were also wounded there was blood and we were scratched all over--we got our share. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the troops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait the slaughter would have been even greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the genocide. Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city and at their orders we were assigned special people to accompany us experts. We went to ' pick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock in the morning it was already March 1 it was raining very hard and it was quite cold and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were about six burned people in there and the small corpse of a burned child. It was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people there but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too she had been . . . well there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a man there too several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces were disfigured they were in such awful condition... Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father and the death of my father and how we fought and the people's sorrow and especially the morgue. I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was established and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history. I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They even fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers setting them on fire. They weren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office right across from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The inhabitants of some of the buildings also Azerbaijanis threw rocks at the soldiers from windows balconies even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They weren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket office I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department came to anyone's aid. No one came to help us either to our home even though perhaps they could have come and saved us. As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs near the bus station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived on which floors--they had lists the bandits. You can tell that the operation was  planned in advance. Thanks of

In keeping with the spirit of the times condoms would be a tax deductible expense.  This policy does not discriminate on a gender basis nor would it apply to domestic animals of either nationality. Joint Palestinan-Israeli teams would be obligated to ensure that all acts were voluntary and promptly rewarded. The teams of Palestinian-Israel Morals Patrols or PIMPS would receive a percentage of the financial income in order to encourage their participation and add to their incentive in locating suitable candidates. |> I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as |> well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Shouldn't that be insemination? |> Elias Davidsson Post Box 1760 121 Reykjavik ICELAND -- Shai Guday              | Stealth bombers OS Software Engineer    | Thinking Machines Corp. |	the winged ninjas of the skies.

Since then no serious Israeli leader (including Shamir) really thinks the the occupied territories worth the trouble. The only question became the question of price and other quantitative detail. The best thing the Palestinians can do for themselves these days is to stop the Intifada and try to live as normally as possible (I know it's hard under occupation). Otherwise people might think that five years of stone throwing (as justified as it may be) has caused the Palestinians an irreversible damage that prevents them from running a normal state when the time comes.

Not only because it is the polite thing to do but also to avoid addressing ladies with Mr. as you have done.

It seems that you know as little about the history and the demography of the island as you know about the essence of Turkey's military intervention to it under international agreements.

The fighting The word troops is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the Haganah observer Pa'il the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village a small group of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty. Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account. Incidentally three times as heavy may be correct as there is serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However note that Begin compares wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of wounded Arabs.  Guess why. >was thus very severe.

There is something almost comical in the fact that Yigal Arens is important enough to have the ADL and G-d knows who else sifting through his garbage (which happens to be legal; you throw it out it ain't yours any more). This brings to mind a few possibilities other than the ADL connection: - it is all in Arens' mind. - Bullock may have been working for Arens' friend in the PLO - Arens' father (or is it brother?) Moshe Arens (former Israeli Defense Minister) was spying on him. - Arens hired Bullock to spy on him to get attention. In any case who cares? Robert Siegfried Computer Science Dept.

Your claim that the Lebanese/Syrian Landlords sold Palestine (if true even partially) omits the fact that the mandate treaty put Lebanon and Syria under French rule while Palestine under british.  Obiviously any such landlord would have found himself a foreigner in Palestine and would be motivated to sell regardless of the price. It is interesting though that you acknowledge that the palestinians were shafted. Do many Israelis or Jews share your opinion ?  Do you  absolve the purchaser from any ethical commitments just because it wasn't written down? All told I did not see an answer in your response. The question was whether the intent behind the purchase was aimed at controlling the public assets (land infra-structure etc...).

(Re: the newsgroup -- followups set to talk.politics.mideast where this belongs.) This may make the term 'civil war' dubious but it does nothing to the phrase 'destroy the government'. An occupying government is still a govern- ment and the Palestinians have made it quite clear that their goal is not simply to prevent it from occupying the territories that don't con- fer citizenship (which is your own determination of the distinction) but to wipe it out entirely (and not incidentally the entire Jewish population it rules with it). This is an intent to 'destroy the government' no matter where the government happens to be from. >If the >current government in Isreal would be willing to let all adult individuals >who are capable  to >vote in elections within the _DEFACTO_ boundaries of the Isreali >state a requirement for being called a democracy in my opinion Wasn't a requirement for democracy in Athens. For that matter isn't a requirement for the term democracy in the United States which doesn't let non-citizens vote either. Both the United States and Israel have processes whereby it is possible to acquire citizenship with a great deal of effort and a modicum of screening -- it's just that it isn't automatic for living in the territories. It isn't automatic for living in New York either. That said suit yourself. Having never considered democracy the ultimate in Good In This World I could care less if you feel like calling Israel or America or anywhere else a democracy. Personally I withhold the term from Israel for the same reason I withhold it from Britain... the parliamentary system is a serious handicap. >then Mr. Frank would be correct.  As the current government neither >is willing to >enfrachise the vast majority of individuals in the territories or to >allow these people to have the right to self determination it is not >a civil war or THEIR government rather it is resitance to a FOREIGN >occupier. Again suit yourself. In which case Israel is *not* attacking its own people it is fighting a war on foreign soil in which case the residents are entitled to play rough yes -- but Israel's allowed to get just as rough within the bare limits of the rules of war. This includes among other things the right to shoot or bomb *anyone* a national of the coun- try in question who is fighting them (which permits mass frontal assault on all rock-throwers) along with the right to take out any installation of military importance (certain villages with too-good fortifications can be handled by aerial bombing as can waterways since they count as supply lines to the enemy) and the right to do anything whatsoever to whatever constitutes a government that they can lay hands on (if Hamas is trying to set up as the ruling party let them beware). If this is not the scenario you want I recommend you go back to calling it a civil war. Civil wars have to be handled nicer. You cannot say the Palestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreign nation and still call Israel a government who is treating its own people cruelly. If the Palestinians are fighting a war against a foreign country so is Israel and the gloves come *off*. -Naomi -- Yes it is bread we                                May the Source of peace fight for but we fight      Naomi Rivkis          in the heavens bring peace for roses too.          rivk@midway.uchicago.edu   to us and to all Israel.

I would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might wait until I express an opinion before deciding I should be flamed for it. As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally think that 'war' as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever requires organisation planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces. Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause for criticism it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the 'Zionist' camp. >Of course this isn't war since it's only the Arabs attacking. Now you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start with the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something. And the previous posters were wrong no? >Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets >against Northern israel.  Where does uprising end and war begin? Again I am not sure I doubt you want my opinion anyway but I think war requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command and plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you sure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds like war to me. Stone throwing does not.

Joseph Biden D-Del. told Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Biden chastised the administration and its Republican predecessor for what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims including rape and shelling of civilians. ``The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact that all the options are bad ones'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones and we ought to pick a couple.'' Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs. Christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to **************************************************** the radical Islamic government of Iran. *************************************** O I C!

2,In article <1483500368@igc.apc.org> Center for Policy Research <cpr@igc.apc.org> writes: % %By Elias Davidsson - April 1991 (Revision Oct. 1991) Note - you are already posting facts some of which are outdated. The biased presentation of facts as well as the conclusions that you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful exchange that might lead to a meeting of the minds.  It is to those who read with open mind that I address myself. %The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of %Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the %United Nations in 1965 has now been ratified by most member %states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial %discrimination as any distinction exclusion restriction or %preference based on race colour descent or national or ethnic %origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing %the recognition enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of %human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political economic %social cultural or any other field of public life. While the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals as the text currently stands I know of no country in which racial discrimination of some sort can not be found. It makes no mention of the need for for a legislative violation. %The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining %Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The %important correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since %it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli %racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States on behalf of %Israel are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United %Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial %practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy. If you are in principle advocating UN intervention via operative statements in this case it must therefore hold that they can be applied to any other case where the council perceives some form of racial discrimination as previously exhibited. Scarey thought. %The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of %the world (but not to its inhabitants) alienates all native %non-Jews born in that country. Actually I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not alienated by this law.  If you had said some you would probably be correct however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes apparent.  This slant permeates the text. %Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas %under Israeli control identify themselves as Palestinians. Most %of them are Muslim many are Christian. A few Jews including the %author of these lines also identify themselves as Palestinians. The above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting Beduins Circassians Druze and some other fringe groups. Your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the issue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group]. %Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim %was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant %opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population). If I recall correctly at the time zionism took off there was no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any factual contradictory evidence . %But the %Zionists were more powerful militarily economically and %technologically and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the %area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native %Arabs from the conquered areas approximately 750000 people and %razing most of their villages to the ground the Zionists could %finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150000 %non-Jews remained on Israeli territory. Do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on most of their villages? %Once the Jewish State was established it began enacting laws to %help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews their %political repression and their destitution. There is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later used for these purposes.  However you seem to imply that this was the intention a priori which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was that this was not the case. You also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded this.  As you do again below. %In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied %the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus %another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its %occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered %illegal by the international community as reflected in Security %Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and %began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these %territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time. Not quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them. Israel never annexed the Sinai West Bank or Gaza.  The other annexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions. %Part of these territores East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights %have already been forcefully annexed by Israel in defiance of %international law and UN resolutions. Out of curiousity provided that the annexees are granted citizenship what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories captured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country previously (other than Iraq) ? %It must be emphasized that although these people live under %different regimes they are united in their self-perception as %Palestinians that is as people identifying with Palestine a %territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity). Incorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against on an ethnic or racial basis.  Therefore your above statement is incorrect. I also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically. However no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist at the time of the creation of Israel in which case you can not argue racial discrimination during that period! %Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a %symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that %represents them in world affairs. Once again some do some don't. %The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab %territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant %discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation. Another generalization but then again you don't seem to care about anyone other than the Palestinian people whose cause you espouse. %licence to start a business and to buy industrial equipment the %right to educate children all of these basic rights are subject %to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be %challenged in court. Incorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal. Furthermore although you may not agree with them not all of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some are but this is not due to the whims of the military as much as the sizeof the task/organization. %Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied %territories are permitted to carry firearms. Incorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in Daheisha and there were more.  Of course with the outbreak of the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign bitterly. %Jewish settlers have %right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents %of these territories number now about 100000 people. It is Israel %governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially in %total defiance of international law UN resolutions and the will %of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates %land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish %settlement. That is no longer true and I can't help but wonder what your purpose is/was in posting this. %Some 800000 people in Israel properare not Jews. Most of them %consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For %many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected %to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by %the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish %settlement. They have been subject to massacres destitution and %humiliation. While they enjoy with Jewish Israelis the right to %vote they are discriminated against both through law and in %practice. Once again to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in right?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way you seem to indicate Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes some did but as a result of what actions? %Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the %Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are %second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on %such land nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these %policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied %residence and membership rights in most rural communities in %Israel including the collective settlements kibbutzim. Non-Jews %are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government %starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of %funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos; %Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their %non-Jewish neighbors Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and %understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian %children are denied the right to learn their history and %literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end %of racial discrimination suffer continuous harassment by the %authorities. 1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members. It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no legislation against it nor against a purely non-Jewish collective. 2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population it has never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large bloc and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case in point. 3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation with regard to educational material.  You have obviously never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank. It is based upon Jordan's school system. 4.  With regard to your last statement it is simply another gross generalization. %The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of %all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never %openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the %country of its native Palestinian population that is its %ultimate Judaization) Israeli government policies towards %non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is %made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs %into Israeli public life. Thus although comprising approximately %17% of the population of Israeli citizens no Palestinian citizen %of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member as director of %ministry or of a national institution as judge of the Supreme %Court as ambassador of Israel or in any leading position in %Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the %Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes such a thing exists! - is a Jew. Another generalization but lets not stop here. The transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't Moledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the territories not the country itself.  With regard to other items I recall at least one Arab ambassador and the rest was covered previously. %Although sexual %relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal %they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal %of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system %nurtures this attitude in a systematic way. When was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true nor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and the lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one. %Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state based on %equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has %not produced any written Constitution. Simply incorrect. The answer is political.  Once again your failure to understand the dynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't relegates your contentions to the sidelines. %Zionism predicates a state %where Jews have privileged rights. Thus according to Israeli law %a Jew born in London who has never visited Israel does not speak %Hebrew and professes atheism is granted automatic Israeli %citizenship while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be %Christian or Muslim are treated almost as aliens.  Racial %discrimination as defined in international law is thus not only %reflected in Israeli laws and policies but is grounded in the %very nature of Israel as a Jewish state. But the discrimination is not based upon race. Oops sorry nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths. %Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that %does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel - %that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed %to fail. Real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail. Of course I wouldn't expect you to understand wrapped up as you are in your VIEW of things.  Let's not let anything penetrate shall we!?!

Early Zionist fighters did no such things. This is historically incorrect.  Early Zionist 'fighters' did indeed target civilians.  They made random attacks in Arab marketplaces killing innocent passers-by.  Your assertion of the opposite is an attempt to whitewash history.  Anyone can read about the history of the Zionist terrorists.  A good book to start is the one by J. Bowyer Bell an expert in international terrorism.  (His main interest is Irish terrorism.)

If Irgun had to attack civilian targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some objective I'm sure they would have done so.  I also don't exclude Irgun's action against British soldiers as terrorism. The British were showing signs of favoring a compromise with regards to Palestine and the Irgun and branch off groups made a point to kill young British recruits so that mothers and fathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continued presence in Palestine.  Sounds like a form of terrorism to me and not much removed from Arab terrorism.  We must not also forget that Irgun or Irgun branch off groups [more likely] killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they or who cooperated with the British. I'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy but I'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they were a bit screwed.

Yes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed. This is of course simple to resolve the Haganah sent a soldier to report on the massacre. He brought a photographer with him. He sent in a report. The Israeli government suppressed it. Now the government was a Labour Government. Since then the Revisionists have gotten into power but for some reason Likud didn't release the report and its pictures either. Perhaps you might want to tell me why? If it happened as you claim then there will be no pictures of men shot in the head with their hands tied behind their backs no women and children shot as they slept. Yet for some reason they did not take the chance to clear their own name. You have a reason for this don't you? I somehow doubt it. The facts are exactly as the people responsible claim - a premeditated mass murder nothing else. No Iraqi soldiers no other fighting. Just ethnic cleansing at work.

You knew that didn't you? Perhaps you might want to add up all the Jewish civilians killed during the 48 War. I'll opt for the massacre at Deir Yassin. Which do you think is the greater? >In 1983 however Eric Silver of _The Guardian_ (Britain) >interviewed a survivor Mophammed Sammour who testified that 116 out >of a population of 800-1000 were killed. While we are talking about this man I have included more of his testimony that Harry naturally does not use nor does Myths and Facts. I wonder why. No doubt he was lying right Harry? The reason was mainly economic. That is to capture booty in order to maintain the bases which we had then established with very poor resources. The main idea despite this remained the conquest of the village by force of arms something which was then unknown in the country and became a turning point in Jewish military operations Yehuda Lapidot Jabontinsky Archives Testimony Apart from the military discussion the Lehi put forward a proposal to liqui- date the residents of the village after the conquest in order to show the Arabs what happens when the IZL and the Lehi set out together on an operation and for another main reason - it would cause a great uproar throughout the land and would be an important turning point in the course of the battles. The clear aim was to break the Arab morale and raise somewhat the morale of the Jewish commu- nity in Jerusalem which had been hit hard time after time especially recenctly by the desecration of Jewish bodies which fell into Arab hands Yehuda Lapidot Jabotinsky Archives testimony as quoted by Yisrael Segal in The Deir Yassin File published by Koteret Rashit 19th January 1983 So it wasn't like the Holocaust more like Lidice - a warning a punishment. Collective and inflicted on unarmed innocents just not as through. When it comes to prisoners old people and children there were differences of opinion but the majority was for liquidation of all the men in the village and any other force that opposed us whether it be old people women or children Benzion Cohen Commander of the attack on Deir Yassin (J.A.T.) Let me put in some words here a. premeditated b. murder What do you say about the eyewitness testimony of the man in command? We had prisoners and before the retreat we decided to liquidate them. We also liquidated the wounded as anyway we could not give them first aid. In one place about eighty Arab prisoners were killed after some of them had opened fire and killed one of the people who came to give them first aid. Arabs who dressed up as Arab women were also found and so they started to shoot the women also who did not hurry to the area where the prisoners were concentrated (J.A.T.) Shooting prisoners the wounded as a warning to hurry? Sounds VERY familiar to me how about you? Heard of other people other places doing these things? In one case - the Zahran family - only one out of twenty five survived. In another house they caught the sixteen year old son Fuad. His mother was holding him. They killed him with a knife. The mother spent twenty years after that in a mental hospital. A young woman and her two year old baby were shot in the street. Their bodies were left there. They moved to the centre of the village and started to kill everybody they saw or heard as soon as anybody opened his door. They were using bombs [grenades] machine-guns submachine-guns. My cousin escaped with bullet-holes in his clothes. One of the officers put his machinegun through a window and started shooting outwards killing everybody who moved. They killed my uncle Ali Hassan Zeidan and my aunt Fatima. She heard him call 'help me'. She ran to him and they killed her. Another neighbour Haj Yarah heard some voices and came out. They killed him too. His son Muhammad who was about seventeen heard his father call him and went to the same place. They killed him. His mother heard her son cry for help. She ran out and they killed her. That was near my house. I saw this Muhammad Arif Sammour Funny how 'Myths and Facts' does not see fit to include this too - after all if he is reliable enough to report casualties why not the actual events? What do you say about this Harry? In the exchange that followed four men were killed and a dozen were wounded.. ..by noon time the battle was over and the shooting had ceased. Although there was a calm the village had not yet surrendered. The Irgun and Lehi men came out of hiding and began to 'clean' the houses. They shot whoever they saw women and children included the commanders did not try and stop the massacre...I pleaded with the commander to order his men to cease fire but to no avail. In the meantime twenty five Arabs had been loaded on a truck and driven through Mahane-Yehuda and Zichron Yosef. At the end of the drive they were taken to the quarry bvetween Deir Yassin and Givat Shaul and murdered in cold blood Meir Pa'il interview with Yediot Ahronot 4|4|1972 -- Joseph Askew Gauche and Proud  In the autumn stillness see the Pleiades jaskew@spam.maths.adelaide.edu  Remote in thorny deserts fell the grief.

Tell us how many Poles went into the Ghetto to join the Jews there.  Oops!  For a moment there I forgot that in Poland 'humanitarian assistance could get you killed.  Come to think of it humanitarian assistance to the Gazans can get Israelis killed too.  Except that in Gaza it's likely to be by a Gazan death squad in your own office. So let's keep the parallel.  Since the gross numbers aren't the same we'll need a proportionality value.  Should we use: * Gazan vs Jewish initial population? * Gazan vs Jewish death rates? * Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation? * Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the 'resistance'? * Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims? Since the two cases are so comparable it shouldn't matter which we pick they'll all be about the same right? ------------ Contrary to popular hyperbole the IDF *could* quite easily kill off the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to. (No I'm not exaggerating.  And I really don't want to discuss how.) Note that a million dead Gazans don't get much more headline space than a dozen and are just as soon forgotten -- and once exterminated they can't keep popping up as headlines. So if a Final Solution for Gaza would be so much better from a *Realpolitik* standpoint why doesn't Israel go for it?  A difficult question to answer for those who can't believe anything good about Jews and probably why they keep trying to force-fit the facts into the theory. --- D. C.

2,Arab citizens have the all the same rights as Jews.  Arabs are exempt from military service but that is about it.  Arabs have a full voice in Israeli politics to the degree that they choose to get involved.  They may vote.  There are Arabs in the Cabinet. The claim that Israel is an apartheid state is a racist claim one which is based on a total disregard for the facts and a total hatred for Israel.

There is no doubt that Israeli authorities ordered the destruction of mosques in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall. That does not mean however that once can generalize from this to any other points.  The entire plaza mosques and all was cleared to make it possible for Jews to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of them and which had been denied to them for millenia. On the other hand throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel to the best of my knowledge Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided damage to any Islamic religious sites. This contrasts with the policies of previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and bigotry. -- ________________________________________ Jack F.

Which makes an interesting point. People living in a Jewish State have shown that Jewish culture includes in it Jewish religion but they are not the same. So the Jewish people living in the Jewish State have shown us that there are some problems in a State where 80% of the people is secular but Judaism is define according to religious standards or where marriage is a religious stage or where the Law of Return defines a Jew according to a religious standard. Did those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become non-Jews? Why should they still define then a Jew based on what is a religious definition? >>Maybe I would consider hypocrisy to support Zionism and disregard the >>right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and their struggle to >>reach it. > >If you'd wanted to say that in the first place you should have said it >then.

First off what is the deal with your subject lines? Do you think that you are being funny? Ha ha.  What a developed sense of humor you have I'm surprised they let you out of the cage.  Why don't we not talk about the official definition of foreign aid and talk about where money is really spent.  More money is spent stationing troops in Germany (ie paying the troops maintaining bases and equip etc) than in Israel.  Plus Israel does not ask the US to send troops to fight her battles.  If you look at the amount of money spent defending Korean shipping lanes Norway and other trouble spots in the world you will see that aid to Israel - from a practical standpoint - is not that much.  And so what - so what if Israel gets the most (assuming I buy your feeble argument)?  What is your point?  Do you not want to subsidize Israel?  Well you have two options 1) Start your own campaign get elected as president and then force congress to cut all aid to Israel or 2) get the fuck out!  If  you don't like how this country operates and can't change it then move to Iran or something. All my love Ed.

We had a most peculiar little locomotive originally built in America for the Russian Government adapted to burn either wood or oil; one covered truck as men's quarters; one similar which I fitted up for my- self and a railway officer; and also a truck to carry wood three cars being the utmost our small engine could pull. With this small outfit we started rumours of all kinds reaching us before our departure indicating that the whole situation was rapidly coming to a head it being evident that the Turks were becoming~ more and more restive in the face of the inexplicable delay of the Allies in reaching any definite decision with regard to the future. Travelling on this little war-time railway was indeed an experience and it was necessary to carry a gauge and to test the rails with it frequently for in many places owing to the sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the ballast the rails required rectification before we were able to get our train over even at a foot pace; each bridge also re- quired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon it and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim- ber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts whilst we passed over them. Under these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog- ress was by no means rapid and as we had frequently to halt also to replenish our supply of wood fuel we considered we had achieved wonders when on the evening of the second day 60 hours and 70 miles out from Erzeroum we finally entered the gorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles to lie. This is the same gorge into which the road from Erzeroum to Kars descends from the foot-hills to cross the frontier; the railway however follows the main Aras River val- ley till the frontier gorge enters it whilst the road cuts off the corner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of Zivin some 15 miles from the main valley. Soon after entering the gorge we were confronted by the first serious fall of rock--about 2000 tons having fallen from the cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track. Here therefore we halted and sending our engine back prepared to -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | Armenia has not learned a lesson in S.D.P.A.

I'll leave questions 1 and 2 to be answered elsewhere but on question 3) something in the noos today might be an example of the restoration might be. Namely that the Clinton Administration is considering asking the UN to establish a police force for Haiti. I didn't hear any thing that said that the current Govt. of Haiti asked for it nor is there any real precedent (barring Somalia) for the UN getting involved in internal conflicts. That might also answer question 2). The neo-colonial countries are a diffuse lot - the UN (Security Council). And while I am at it I'll take a stab at 1) - the new colonialism as defined in most articles I have read would entail something of the nature of Trusteeship under the UN Sec. Council democracy aid education free-markets free press and then out for the colonialists now assured that there is a civilized country that they have left behind. Note I don't support this idealized concept simply because I think it is a lot of hogwash. -- Srinivas Sunder                                         sunder@crhc.uiuc.edu If The University of Illinois shares these views I'd be surprised.

Which nationality will the child's ID show according to each one of the following cases: a) F and M are both Jewish. b) F is Jewsh and M is not. c) F is Muslim and M is jewish. d) F is Christian and M is Jewish. e) F and M are both non-Jewish. > >>Did those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become >>non-Jews?

Lets look into this. According to my dictionary Zi-on-ism: an international movement orig. for the establishment of a Jewish national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of modern Israel. Now I do not support the establishment of nations based on religious principles while I support the establishment of nations based on cultural identities. So. Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer. My point is what someone said long time ago: In politics like with men it is important to distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually doing. 1) My mother is Jewish (and so is my father). If I apply for the Law of Return do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land from which my family was expelled about 2000 years ago? 2) If I go back which nationality would my ID show? 3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been expelled 2000 years ago but first I convert to any other religion can I apply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I apply as someone whose mother is Jewish? 4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)? 5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted to loose my being part of the Jewish Nation? 6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife who is non-Jewish in Israel how do I do it? 7) How would my situation change if I decided after going back to Israel to convert to Islam? Now here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a country do not care about politics. They just want to be left alone. Suppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine in some place which now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father and his grandfather as well as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place. Now suppose there is a war of independence and my father scared by all the fighting going on tries to take his family to a place more secure among people he knows who speak a language he understands who worship the same god. Now suppose that that place is some other Arab country. And now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created where my father used to live and that that country is called Israel. And that in that country Jews from all over the world are received. And that people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and granted full-citizenship. Should I if I decided to go back to my father's land where he was born as 20 or 30 generations of my family were born have the right to go back and ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000 years? Then finally people ask me how I would define a Jew but that is irrelevant. I am not talking about how I would define a Jew but about how people in Zionist organizations and more important in Israel define a Jew. How would those who are Zionist define a Jew? > >>     Eric S.

Why is democracy better than tribalism or other means of Govt.? The President of Georgia was elected with a thumping majority and booted out later w/ no objections from the UN. Similarly the people of Algeria elected an Islamic Fundemantalist Party into power but the junta declared it illegal. In both cases I personally have _no_ problems with the outcome but if the voice of the people is that hallowed thing that the world community claims to revere so why isn't it interfering there? |> the U.S. or any other democracy wishes to they are in the perfect right to |> help them without any whining from thir parties.  After all if it turns out to |> be colonialism and the poeple don't like it they' find a way to throw them out . Exactly. My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way and we can save ourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their problems on their own. Colonial interventions even in Haiti haven't worked in the past. They had a 102 coups from 1845-1915. The US invaded in 1915. And left in 1933 almost 17 years after they had intended to. Was it a success? Well look at Haiti today and of the past 40 years and decide for yourself. It _was_ a success so long as the US was in from what I remember. But it didn't last long obviously. |> >There is an implicit assumption here that we as outsiders have a right to sit |> >in judgement of another people and to then act on it.

We finally have a clearly-stated point of difference. Colonialism can have its good side which is as you stated above - removing thugs from being able to lord it over powerless people. I am worried that the bad side is what will assert itself and I am prepared to let natural forces take their course if that will mean we can avoid the bad side of colonialism. -- Srinivas Sunder                                         sunder@crhc.uiuc.edu If The University of Illinois shares these views I'd be surprised.

Thanks for posting the references. I do not normally read t.p.m. and I posted my request for references because Jim's article was cross-posted to soc.culture.jewish. Allegations of Jewish disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture and rumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms than blood libel. The stereotypes that pervade our culture create cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. Therefore any claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented. If such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it has not been documented before such as s.c.j a reference should be given the first time it appears.  Now that the claim has been documented I regard the whole episode as disgusting and shameful. Especially so because the official who failed to provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted Jordanians was probably Jewish and as a Jew I know that he should have known better.

This was war!  It was certainly not any eye for an eye characterstic.  Israelis do not harbor the same feelings of revenge as the Arabs generally do.

You're just beginning to scratch the surface.  Do you know how much military equipment costs?  When was the last time you tried to buy a mil-spec hammer coffee-pot or toilet seat?

If he gives you the same story explaining the presence of several synagogues in the Moslem Quarter then the story becomes suspect... In reality the Old City was not as neighborhooded in the past as it became after 1948.  In pre-Israel Jerusalem there were many Jews in what is now called the Moslem Quarter.  There are postal and telephone directories from that time to prove it.  It's really rather interesting to hear Arabs there claim that a house or store has been in the family for centuries even when there are clear photos and documents that show a Jewish-owned business at the same location just a few decades ago. -- Jake Livni  jake@bony1.bony.com           Ten years from now George Bush will American-Occupied New York                   have replaced Jimmy Carter as the My opinions only - employer has no opinions.    standard of a failed President.

Alberto you've repeatedly misunderstood my postings.  You are now making the exact point that I've made several times but with a different definition of religion.  You don't not have to believe in the religious aspects of Judaism to be a Jew (this would confine Judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity.).  So by converting out of Judaism I don't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism.  I mean voluntarily removing yourself from the Jewish nation.  I am an agnostic but still consider myself Jewish because of my cultural heritage.  (I admit that many religious jews would argue that I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith but Judaism is a religion of dissent and debate isn't it?).  The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by converting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most open nation.  We have no quotas! So I will once again make my point.  Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion (not as you say religious belief) is NOT racism.  You come to your incorrect conclusion because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and when you define judaism. -Adam Schwartz

Igor and I had thought that if it was a girl we would call her Raisa after my mother-in-law and if it was a boy we'd call him Arsen after Igor's grandfather. I had a girl and I without Igor named her Raisa in honor of her dead grandmother. Our family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew up together we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16. In 1981 when I was 18 we were married. Two children were born to us in Sumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old her name is Kristina and my son Seryozha is four and a half. First I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from work I passed Lenin Square where about 1500 people had gathered. There were Komsomol members there and Pioneers [Children's organization] and there were both Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were shouting There's no room for Christians here! and When we finish with the Armenians we'll go after the Russians! And some even cried Out Death to the Armenians! Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became frightened. I came home breathless and told about everything I had seen downtown. My family couldn't believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich Melkumian wasn't home he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o'clock he returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was smashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I was telling him everything too and he said What is there no longer any government? That same day Igor said Papa something terrible is happening in the city. And he said We'll stay at home no one will drive us from our own home. The day passed. On February 28 that was Sunday we didn't go out. We called our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions and they all said the same thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an Armenian from the neighboring building. Ira my brother-in-law's wife and I called the police: they're wrecking a car help. We called and called and nonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything. On February 29 on Monday even though there were troops in the city we were afraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys I wouldn't be coming in. He agreed and even said Fine don't come in we understand what's going on in town don't come in. Before that on the 28th the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my father-in-law and said Uncle Sergey they broke our windows bad things are happening in town. Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said With my own eyes I saw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don't know he said we should leave town. Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we should go thinking we'd go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together clothes food the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the building manager came by and said Uncle Sergey the situation in town is bad don't go out. My father even opened up to him and said Maybe we'll drive to the dacha it'll be safer there. No he said it'll be worse there you'll be safer at home. He said don't be afraid if something happens I'll send people to save you. After he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our courtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two children Ira and Edik and their daughter my sister-in-law Ira and my mother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family there were three of them Uncle Misha Zhasmen and their daughter Marina. Now when they started breaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us Go in that room and close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won't hear that there's anyone home. The children started crying. Suddenly Ira my brother-in-law's wife suggested Let's run out onto the balcony. We -- the two daughters-in-law and the children and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out onto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said Quick over to the other balcony or they'll kill you all. We lived on the second floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's. At first we couldn't manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time people were coming home from work and many just stood there watching. I pleaded and begged: Please call someone have someone come! I even started shouting. I'll throw down the children I'll throw them down you catch them and take them somewhere so at least the children will survive. Either they were afraid or . . . I don't know what. They looked as though they were watching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I'll say it again these weren't the bandits these were people from the other part of the building and from our entryway they were just regular people passersby. A bus even stopped. I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbing over to the other balcony. Ira my sister-in-law helped us get the children over there. I was pregnant about seven months pregnant. No it wasn't yet seven it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first; you know I just don't remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first I think and Edik's wife Ira and I had the children and they were all screaming and crying. My Kristina said Mamma don't throw us over the balcony we're afraid! Lilia was crying and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina didn't even want to climb over. She shouted I'm staying with Grandmother I'm staying with Grandma! She loved her grandma more than she loved me. And my mother-in-law shouted Oh no Kristina's still there she's still there save Kristina too! Ira helped us climb over with Kristina coming last. Ira helped us and went back inside. We started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door. I pounded with my fist Sevil open the door open it please! She didn't open it. No go away go anywhere go I'm not opening the door. She was our neighbor we were friends we never refused her anything ever! And apparently she thought we were going to break the windows and she opened the door. She opened it and said Karina Karina go away go anywhere just don't stay here they'll kill us too because of you. I begged Please at least take the children we'll leave we'll go back. No she said you have to leave. Her sons ran in one had a knife. Sevil's brother he's around 18 shouted at us: Get out of here leave I'll kill you with this knife! I became terrified I took the children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down and heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard The Armenians must be killed they've taken all the best places all the best apartments! One of them said Let the Armenian blood flow none of them should survive! When I heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their door for me! Not on the third floor or the fourth. I couldn't see Zhasmen any longer. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay that they would save her. My head was spinning. They were killing my family and here I was in the next entryway with two children. Seryozha was four and Kristina was five and a half. They were crying Mamma we're scared! They were so frightened that I didn't even know how to calm them should I try to calm them or myself? It was awful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked Open up let me inside! He opened the door slightly and said No! No and that was it! He said it so sternly: No! I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists on the door with all my might. He opened up the man of the house and stood there looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get down on my knees. Please I beg of you at least take the children. He wasn't an Azerbaijani he was a Lezgin. I don't even know how but he let me inside. And when I went in Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn't passed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn't want to open the door. And again I started pleading Please open the door it's our Ira and Lilia! Open the door! And he said No I'm afraid. I said again and again Please open the door please! He looked at me. He looked at me for a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We threw ourselves into each other's arms crying. Then the man locked us into the bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us Calm the children and calm yourselves down too. Calm down? This man was hiding us but what of our family? When I was still in our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I said Igor Edik let's say farewell. And Edik turned around and looked at me as if to say is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would kill all of us. Igor looked at me too . . . But it was already too late! They started pounding on the door Igor was standing next to the door. Before that he had told us Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight. He thought we were in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: Edik Igor let's say farewell. Igor didn't think we could climb over to the other balcony. And we did get over there and I myself can't believe we were able to save ourselves. Igor put on a helmet and Edik had his coat on and he put on a fur hat. All the men--Igor Edik their father and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next to the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: Open the door! We were all silent waiting. Someone outside the door said They're home they're in there break down the door! And I remember my father-in-law whispering They're going to break it down now it's coming down now . . .  He had something in his hands I think it was a knife: if they got in we were going to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal chair legs. From outside the door they said We're counting to five open up! But we were all quiet we didn't answer them. We made like no one was home. We figured they'd leave they'd get tired and leave. My father-in-law had said It's not possible they'd come into my home. How can that be? Everyone knows us all of Sumgait knows our family we are on good terms with everyone. And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani guest at our table. We had a nice dacha everyone would get together there often Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save ourselves we had to flee from our own home. Ira I remember said I'm not leaving here my brothers and my parents are here I'm going to fight alongside them. That's just what she said. She picked up a knife and said If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight alongside my family I'm not going anywhere. We were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and shouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor at the Lezgin's apartment you could hear everything up there too. Even Ira's voice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a long time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: Open the door what are they doing to Ira who's shouting that's Ira shouting that's her voice! But the Lezgin said It's nothing calm down no it's not in your apartment. He was lying to me so I'd calm down. Two hours went by and the Lezgin opened the door and said Karina Igor got away calm down. He ran away. He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him outside next to the building. While we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The way Ira shouted! She shouted Save me Mamma save me! . . . Mamma Mamma! She repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many people there all of them shouting all of them bellowing howling whistling--you just can't imagine what was going on what the roar was like. Apparently after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway where we were hiding and came upstairs all the way up to the fifth floor. I don't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in particular but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law were climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were our last moments and started saying good-bye to my children kissing them. They were sleeping. I woke them up: Kristina! Seryozha wake up! And I tell Ira: Ira if something happens we'll throw ourselves off the balcony. We were on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door too because later he said I opened the door and told them there were no Armenians inside. And after they all left our neighbor went out on the balcony himself to see: they were gone. We weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors we only knew each other from the building. But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider hiding us. The Lezgin let us out of the bathroo

2,I appeal to to all of you to show up in Washington DC. this saturday to participate in a peaceful demonstration for the sake of humanity!! This is a critical point in the history of world and we can make a change otherwise things will not change there in Bosnia.. Rapes/killings/ethnic cleansing will go on as a norm in the days to follow. The UN will get to the towns after the fall of thousands of inocent civilians (like in Zapa just the past weekend!). It happened to the Jews in 1940's it's happening to the muslims today and who will be the next victim?? Since the Europeans want to remain indifferent in this issue time has come for US to take a leadership role to stop these crimes against humanity. Time is now and this is for real folks the people of New England Bosnian Relief Committee seriously believe that Clinton's Adminstration will stop supporting the Bosnian cause without sustained public pressure. I just called Democaratic Sen. John Kerry's office and they are saying that he (the senator) is waiting for president to take a decision means that he will wait and join the band-wagon later if it ever moves! Please don't rely on others to take part in this demonstration -You as an individual will make a big difference. Bring your families too not only you will help a great cause but also it will be fun for all. I know of several families from Massachusetts who are travelling friday night to participate there. Contact the local Islamic center or Bosnia relief agency if you want to travel by pre-arranged busses. The best option for students is to rent-a-car and car-pool. Please spread the word around... Regards Khalid Chishti If you live in Massachusetts and want more info: Call Ginan (from New England Bosnian Relief Committee): 617-623-1973 OR New England Bosnian Relief Committee phone no:  (617) 464-0111 Disclaimer: These are my opinions only and has nothing to do with my employer...

2,I think there are some generally accepted criteria according to which one can evaluate whether certain policies or practices constitute racial discrimination. These criteria are to be found for example in the 1.  International Convention for Abolition of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ratified by most countries) 2.   The International Covenant of Political and Civil Rights 3.   The Human Rights Charter 4.   The European Convention of Human Rights If one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these legally binding instruments and does not resort to sophistry it is obvious that the State of Israel is guilty of racial discrimination. The people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion by the Zionist regime are the Palestinian refugees some of whom live under Israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora. They are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole reason that they are not Jews. International law does not include any provisions which permits such denial of rights under any circumstance. Israel's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. By allowing the return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in Tel in any area  of the State of Israel the State would finally gain its legitimaty under international law and could be justified in asking to be recognized. It would facilitate the peaceful integration of Israel into the Middle-east and constitute the best guarantee for permanent Jewish presence - in the area. Any attempt to create a separation formal and human between the Israeli Jewish and Palestinian Arab communities is fraught with genociadal implications. I hope that U.S. Jews who sincerely wish that peace prevail in Israel/Palestine will finally realize this fact. Elias Davidsson PS: Please read carefully the first post in this topic where the facts of Zionist racial discrimination are described.
2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Zionist leaders' frank statements The following are quotations from Zionist leaders. They appear in numerous scholarly works dealing with the Palestine question. I urge those who have access to original sources to verify the authenticity of the source and post here their finding adhering to the truth whatever it be. Thanks. Elias Davidsson ------------------------------ Quotations from Zionist leaders 1. There was no such thing as Palestinians (Golda Meir Prime Minister of Israel London Sunday Times 15 June 1969) 2. There is however a difficulty from which the Zionist dares not avert his eyes though he rarely likes to face it. Palestine proper has already its inhabitants. (Israel Zangwill The Voice of Jerusalem London 1920 p.88) 3. When we have settled the land all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle. (Raphael Eitan Israeli Chief of Staff New York Times 14 April 1983) 4. [The Palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs. (Menachem Begin Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to the Knesset quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk 'Begin and the Beasts New Statesman 25 June 1982) 5. Both the process of expropriation [of the Palestinians] and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly. (Dr. Theodor Herzl The Complete Diaries Herzl Press 1960 I. p.88) 6. Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both people together in this country...The only solution is a Palestine.....without Arabs. And there is no other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighboring countries to transfer all of them; not one village not one tribe should be left. (Joseph Weitz Jewish National Fund administrator responsible for Zionist colonization. Davar 29 September 1967). 7.We shall try to spirit the penniless population [the Palestinians] across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries while denying it any employment in our own country (Theodor Herzl The Complete Diaries Herzl Press 1960 I p.88) 8. [Zionists]...looked for means...to cause the tens of thousands of sulky Arabs who remained in the Galilee to flee...I gathered all the Jewish muktars who have contact with Arabs in different villages and asked them to whisper in the ears of some Arabs that a great Jewish reinforcement has arrived in Galilee and that it is going to burn all of the villages of the Huleh. They should suggest to these Arabs as their friends to escape while there is still time....The tactic reached its goal....wide areas were cleaned.

2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Labour's enclaves policy.IMPORTANT Labour's enclaves policy in the occupied territories by Israel Shahak publ. in Middle East International London 30.4.93 It is not difficult to discover Israel's policy towards the Palestinians at any given time. It can be easily inferred from the facts on the ground and from the information provided by the Hebrew press. There is one condition though. The torrents of claptrap about the peace process must be totally ignored as must Israel's official pronouncements whole sole purpose is to distort reality. By concentrating only on the facts it was early apparent that Labour's policies were no different from those of Shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their more effective implementation. Likud's policies were accurately described by Ariel Sharon in an article accompanied by a map in Yediot Aharonot last August. The Sharon plan envisaged a division of the West Bank into seven and the Gaza Strip into four autonomous Palestinian enclaves all of them under Israeli supervision. The total area of these enclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the territories. The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli settlements and the highways built around the enclaves. The entire area around Jerusalem from the outskirts of Ramallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem has already been turned into a Greater Jerusalem where the Arab- inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded by areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for them. Judging from Labour's settlement policy it may be assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number of Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had planned. But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by settlements strategically dispersed along the highways remains unchanged. Labour plans only four enclaves in the West Bank: two in Samaria and two in Judea (i.e. north and south of Jerusalem respectively) and no more than two in the Gaza Strip. In regard to Greater Jerusalem Labour's policies hardly deviate from Sharon's. A saner version of Likud policy As some Israeli correspondents at once realised Labour policies were but a saner version of Sharon's extravaganza. Last July Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot Aharonot that while barely a few months ago Labour supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond the Green Line no specific decision to freeze construction in the territories has been taken. And Uzi Benziman wrote in Ha'aretz that as far as can be judged on the basis of the internal political discussions in Jerusalem Rabin intends to stick to Likud's ways. The two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are located in Samaria. Therefore the belt of settlements around the Trans-Samaria Highway designed to separate those enclaves from each other is of paramount importance. According to the latest data the percentage of Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population (apart from East Jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. But for the area around the Trans-Samaria Highway the corresponding figure is almost 20 per cent and it is increasing steadily. The situation in the settlements of the Efrat Block south of Jerusalem designed to sever the enclave around Bethlehem from the one around Hebron is pretty much the same. The Efrat Block is now being connected with West Jerusalem by a highway. The project is costly in the extreme because the highway is designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long tunnels. The final decision to build this highway was suspended until Rabin's return from his US visit in March. The subsequent decision to renew its construction can be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a whole. Process of impoverishment The enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady impoverishment of the Palestinians. This is well known in Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be concerned including the PLO. In regard to the Gaza Strip the whole process was best described by Ze'ev Shiff in Ha'aretz in March. He mentions having seen a pamphlet issued six years ago by the Civil Administration forecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli rule in 2000. His analysis deserves to be quoted extensively: We continue to steal the Strip's water even though its quality deteriorates from year to year. We continue to steal the Strip's tiny land resources in order to found there more and more settlements as if we deliberately want to make the inhabitants despair and in their despair think in termws of having nothing to lose. It is by our own doing that the Strip's workers must now spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time as they spend working. From the military point of view we have kept control of no more than half the Strip's area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and resources. About a year before Moshe Arens left the defence ministry I heard him saying that we should withdraw from the Strip come what may. His argument was that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and deeper. He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak Shamir but he rejected it. Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too. Enormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being implemented. The Qatif Block settlements founded by the first Rabin government of 1974-77 are intended to divide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves. Efraim Davidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli this enterprise is. The Qatif Block is now producing 40 per cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export and a substantial proportion of cut flowers. He also deals with the subsidies the settlers receive considerably augmented by the present government. Owing to them housing units are cheap. The present government does not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block. Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage for his house on top of a grant of 18000 shekels ($6500). Such data shows that Israel's plans apply whether the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to work in Israel. The economic motivations were explained by Danny Rubinstein in Ha'aretz in March: From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be sealed off hermetically and all the Strip's workers could be barred from entering Israel...Even though accurate data is hard to come by it is indisputable that during the last two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving daily to work in Israel has markedly decreased from 80000 in the mid'80s to 40000 today. But the decrease is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel from Gaza. It is also due to the drastic curtailment of demand for Gazan labour in Israel. With unemployment in Israel soaring and the construction of apartments blocks virtually halted the workers from Gaza are no longer really needed... Gaza's total dependence The entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent on Israel. In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has been an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli factories mostly footware and textiles. Thousands of small workshops employing an average of four workers get their raw materials or unfinished products together with detailed working instructions from Israeli factories. Rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent of that in the West Bank which in turn stands at half the average wage in Israel; and besides the Gazan employer does not pay any social security for his employees. If the average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that in Israel the profits of Israeli factories and even of Palestinian sub-contractors must be vast. They are higher still when a Gazan sub-contractor provides labour to be performed at home with the family's help. The livelihood of tens of thousands of Gazans depends on such sub-contracted work. Many of them are women and children paid about ten shekels ($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. There can be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition of Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from the Strip. Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from what was created straight after Israel's conquest [in 1967]. In this respect one should not be deluded by the talk nowadays fashionable about Israeli gestures intended to encourage economic development in the territories As Israeli journalists point out all permits for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval by the Shin Bet. Behind all the professed goodwill there is no desire to solve problems just the attitude of a good colonialist willing to do something for the benefit of the natives but on condition that they behave nicely do not become rebellious and never do anything against the interests of the metropolis its economic interests included wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February. The development of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip accords perfectly with Sela's diagnosis. Sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work. In all branches of the economy lobbies have been set in motion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from the threat of any Palestinian competition. The method is simplicity itself. As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds in persuading the government or even the trade and industry minister alone a military order is issued prohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel. If this does not suffice a Palestinian factory may be denied a licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse its production. Among the most active of such lobbies is the agricultural one. It has succeeded in limiting exports of Gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers) not only to Israel but also to Europe where they otherwise might compete with Israeli exports. Perpetuaring apartheid Labour's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in the territories. The same goal is shared by the US which otherwise could not support the Labour government so firmly. In my view one of the reasons the US feels happier about supporting Labour than Likud is its greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. This point was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma'ariv who deplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to Likud's inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly settlement growth occured during the term of office of the National Unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which Rabin served throughout as the defence minister. Likud's reputation for settling the territories better than Labour is false attributable to the many tiny settlements without strategic value founded under Shamir for symbolic reasons. To sum up: Labour's policy unconditionally supported by the US differs from that of Likud primarily in the efficiency with which it is implemented. According to that policy the territories are to be divided into two parts. The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly and the minor part indirectly. In my view this racist scheme is doomed to ultimately fail but at a horrifying price in human suffering. The sooner its true nature is recognised the less suffering it may cause. ************************************
2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Zionists reject non-Jews. News Ethiopian Jews and not-quite Jews The Israeli press has published items about Ethiopian Jews waiting in camps in Addis Ababa for immigration to Israel who are dying of starvation. The following are excerpts from an interview with the former general director of the JDC project for development and welfare of Ethiopian Jews Kobi Friedman (Hadashot 21 April 1993) who has stated that there are people dying in Addis Ababa but they are converts to Christianity: Hadashor published the item about the dying Jews after viewing a video tape filmed last week in Adis Ababa. How do you know that they are actually converts to Chritianity ? If there are Jews on the tape then I don't know what to say. I am speaking from experience when I say that those who remained in Ethiopia are Christians. I know that there have previously been things published in the press by interesting parties and there is no connection between them and reality. What interested parties ? Ethiopian immigrants who want their Christian relatives to come here. What to you recommend that Ethiopian children in Israel do when their parents and the rest of their relatives remain in Ethiopia ? I ask if it is the job of the State of Israel to bring in the 40 relatives who stayed in Ethiopia. Well my answer is that it is not. It would be a better solution economically as well for that young man to buy a one-way ticket to Ethiopia and reunite with his family there. ***************************************** Publ. by The OTHER Front Alternative Information Center Jerusalem Israel 28 April 1993

2,Los Angeles Times Saturday May 8 1993.  Page A11. FIGURE IN ADL SPY CASE ARRESTED AT S.F. AIRPORT ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon arriving from Philippines where he had fled after FBI interrogation. By Jenifer Warren Times staff writer San Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the Philippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law enforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation League was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges police said Friday. Thomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after the FBI questioned him about his activities was apprehended Thursday night after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard was returning home. Gerard 50 was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday morning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count each of computer theft burglary and conspiracy. If convicted on all charges Gerard could face 16 years in prison and $40000 in fines.  Bail was initially set at $250000 after police argued that he was a flight risk but it was later reduced to $20000. A friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon a sheriff's spokeswoman said. Gerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child with whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito and wanted to have his day in court said Police Capt. John Willett his former boss and one of two arresting officers. Gerard an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1982 to 1985 also feared that the CIA was out to kill him Willett said.  In an interview with The Times last month Gerard threatened to disclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he was indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges. Gerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League a prominent Jewish civil rights organization.  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave criminal histories to Roy Bullock a San Francisco art dealer who said he has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years. Investigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock's home computer -- which contained entries on 10000 people and 950 groups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  Files have also been seized under search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents. Gerard could not be reached for comment Friday and his attorney James Lassart did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  In the interview with The Times last month however Gerard acknowledged snooping and sharing some information with Bullock but denied any criminal wrongdoing. Bullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling intelligence to South Africa. ADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independent contractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal activity.  On Friday ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard's arrest has nothing to do with ADL.  Other than that we have no comment on the case. Arab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying according to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to pursue the investigation. We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly disclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement said James Zogby head of the Arab American Institute in Washington. Police meanwhile characterized Gerard's arrest -- the first in the inquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough.  A former police colleague of Gerard Inspector Fred Mollat visited Gerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home. I knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever but we didn't think it would happen this quickly Capt. Willett said. This development really speeds up our timetable on the case. During his 25-year career on the police force Gerard was a highly regarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligence division.  His last assignment was on the gang task force. After FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall he took early retirement and fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan 300 miles south of Manila. Gerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines Airlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard after his six-month hiatus police said. He was surprised when he saw us standing there and got a shocked look on his face Willett said.  Then he said 'Hello I'm back.' -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it! arens@isi.edu
2,Yedi'ot Ahronot April 9 1993.  Excerpt. EACH ONE AND HIS OWN NEVO* (* A reference to General Azri'el Nevo Shamir's Military Secretary. Irrelevant to this excerpt.) By Nahum Barne'a . . . In mid '91 SHABAK found itself in the center of another storm [...]. A year and a half earlier Khaled Sheikh Ali 27 a member of the Islamic Jihad died at the SHABAK installation in Gaza prison.  The two SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put on trial. In September '91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and sentenced them to 6 months in prison.  As far as is known this was the first time in Israel's history that SHABAK operatives were sent to prison.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the director of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the effectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the case were [...] Barak Goldberg and Matza. When they realized that they were on their own the interrogators agreed to talk.  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placed in charge of investigating the affair.  She [...] questioned the directors of all SHABAK divisions.  She investigated only the matter of the death in Gaza prison.  She discovered that not only torture but also the culture of lies which Judge Landau had described in his report of two years before were still very much in existence. Nothing had changed. The report was classified and was seen by only some ten people among them the Prime Minister the people at the top of the judicial system and Judge Landau.  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not know.  After all they were dealing only with a single jail and with low ranking people.  The system bit the bullet and accepted the explanation.  One of SHABAK's high-ranking officials was transfered from his very high position to a less high position. . . . [The culture of lies referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators' policy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were tortured in the course of interrogation.  The Landau commission sought to correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods -- thus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those methods were used to extract a confession.  The fact that the need to lie still persists would seem to indicate that SHABAK is not sticking to the approved torture methods. -- Yigal] -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it! arens@isi.edu

Typical 'virvir' drivel. People will think you're just some looney howling in the wires. If you think that this 'clears things up' for me or anyone else you must also believe that aliens from outer space come to earth regularly and abduct 'Arromdians' of ASALA/SDPA/ARF for medical experiments. There is stronger evidence for *that* you know. 'Propagandist leaflets'? This is an American officer on the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920 not a crook/idiot like yourself. Source: World Alive A Personal Story by Robert Dunn. Crown Publishers Inc. New York (1952). (Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people) p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph). 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.' 'No dammit! My stomach isn't-' 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.' We were under those trees by the mosque in an open space.... 'I don't believe you I said but followed to a nail-studded door. The man pushed it ajar then spurred away leaving me to check on the corpse. I thought I should this charge was so constant so gritted my teeth and went inside. The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes and was dark at first for its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot. All looked bare and empty but in an inner room flies buzzed. As the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face up naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone so I'd no proof which he was and quickly went out gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals. p. 363 (first paragraph). 'How many people lived there?' 'Oh about eight hundred.' He yawned. 'Did you see any Turk officers?' 'No sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.' The lieutenant dozed off then I but in the small hours a voice woke me - Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into laughter quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense of guilt I thought or hoped. For somehow despite my boast of irreligion Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would have been. From daybreak on Armenian villagers poured in from miles around..... The women plundered happily chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels the last scrap of food or cloth and staggered away packing pots saddlebags looms even spinning-wheels. 'Thank you for a lot Dro' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must leave.'...We shook hands the captain said 'A bientot mon camarade.' And for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all doubtless in a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.' p. 354. At morning tea Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics they spoke Russian but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on Moslem villages. p. 358. It will be three hours to take Dro told me. We'd close in on three sides. The men on foot will not shoot but use only the bayonets Merrimanov said jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. That is for morale Dro put in. We must keep the Moslems in terror. Soldiers or civilians? I asked. There is no difference said Dro. All are armed in uniform or not. But the women and children? Will fly with the others as best they may. p. 360. The ridges circled a wide expanse its floors still. Hundreds of feet down the fog held solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that' said Dro pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.' Then 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff the horde - nose to tail bellies taking the spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war even though I heard our Utica brass roar. As I watched from the height it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed dogs barked invisible while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted at first heard faintly. The came a shrill wailing. Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in clump of trees thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks while one twisted a bronze shell-nose loaded and yanked breech-cord firing again and again. Shots wasted I thought when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and tough through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly through alders on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals several calves and a lamb. p. 361 (fourth paragraph). Corpses came next the first a pretty child with straight black hair large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet had gone through her back I judged for blood around was scant. Between the breasts one clot too small for a bullet wound crusted her homespun dress. The next was a boy of ten or less in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the pewter bowl he'd carried now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed just below his neck into the spine. There were grownups too I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead. p. 358. ...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands Turkish troop shifts hidden arms spies - Christian Red or Tartar - coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would break loose if Versailles were to put as threatened the six 'Armenian' vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan... An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. That's bloodshed - just Smyrna over again on a bigger scale.

Source: 'The Sunday Times' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly written by Thomas Goltz from Agdam Azerbaijan.) ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES. The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh. Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more than 450  Azeris many of  them women and  children who were  fleeing an attack  on their  town. Hundreds  possibly thousands  were missing  and feared dead. The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened: That's when the real  slaughter began said  Azer Hajiev  one of three  soldiers to survive. The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.  They were shooting shooting shooting echoed Rasia Aslanova who arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through Armenian lines. She said her husband Kayun and a son-in-law were killed in front of her. Her daughter was still missing. One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off. The survivors  said 2000  others some of  whom had  fled separately were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their wounds or the cold. By late  yesterday 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in Agdam's morgue  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial two  were children and  three were women one shot through the chest at point blank range. Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they had 140 patients who escaped slaughter most with bullet injuries or deep stab wounds. Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city which  has a  population  of 150000  destroying  several buildings  and killing one person. Now wait there is more. IT'S INHUMANE TO IGNORE THIS VIOLENCE The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre: 69 year old Hatin Nine telling: -''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.'' 72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu: - ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours. While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are Turks you must die.'' 28 year old Gulsum Huseyin: - ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes.'' Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region? The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures of people who were bayonetted whose eyes were gouged ears cut off. Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these lies. They are saying exaggeration. That means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach... The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word. Some of the western press' led by some French Newspapers ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre. Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.'' The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe) and rules all designed to fight against human rights violations. International reactions must be made with international cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized. Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals journalists writers TV stations of certain western countries such as France who are fast to claim leadership of human rights? Where are you?

Greek Efforts to Decimate the Jewish Population of Salonica Culminated in 1912 and 1913 <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled particularly to Salonica whose Jewish population increased substantially as a result from 28000 in 1876 to 90000 in 1908 more than half the total population though even there increased persecution by local Greeks led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire particularly to the great port of Izmir. Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike the ritual murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912 and 1913 following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War when many of its Jews were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>> <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to practice their religions without hindrance a law was issued in 1923 which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday stimulating a new Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica with the Cambel quarter where most of the remaining Jews lived being burned to the ground. This was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By killing and driving out large numbers of Jews the Greeks left a substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time and starting Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the occupation of Greece starting in 1941. Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence. Istanbul Edirne and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century and particularly during and after the Crimean War combined with the same independence movements in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among its Jews caused thousands of helpless ill and poverty-stricken Muslim refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the Ottoman Empire with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as 800000 Crimean Tatars Circassians and other Muslims from north and east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone as many as 200000 more came during the next twenty years while 474389 refugees entered in 1876- 1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the Empire.>> [47] Robert Mantran 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle' RH no.534 (1980) 391-92; Nehama VII 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2 12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775 10 January 1900 (AIU Archives I-C-41) describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek children in the streets of Salonica.

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920 the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1000 year homeland.

2,Some articles on the topic: RTw  12/23 0859  GULF ARABS DEMAND IRAN WITHDRAWAL FROM ISLANDS (Eds: updates with end of summit details quotes) By Youssef Azmeh ABU DHABI Dec 23 Reuter - Gulf Arab states emerging from a summit that restored their unity after almost three months of crisis piled pressure on Iran on Wednesday to reverse its virtual annexation of a strategic Gulf island. They issued a statement after a three-day Gulf Cooperation Council summit saying Iran had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding measures that rocked Gulf stability and security. The leaders avoided the anti-Iranian rhetoric of recent statements by Egypt which engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabia and Qatar that allowed all members to attend the summit. Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region and Tehran's alleged encouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind President Hosni Mubarak's mediation. The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf Arab states and Iran is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region's states. It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa which it shares with the United Arab Emirates and the continued occupation of the Greater and Lesser Tumbs islands. Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a small garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the UAE government. But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority over the whole island which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation. The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the UAE has since the Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general settlement. The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against Iraq for not fully implementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. They endorsed once again the Damascus Declaration a pact signed with Egypt and Syria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a fund they announced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year which would have helped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme. They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of contributions from each state although the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the $10 billion agreed last year. The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia Bahrain Kuwait Oman and Qatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although their unity was only maintained with outside help. Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow progress of the conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the region that boasts the bulk of global oil and gas reserves. The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals. One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboos to create a 100000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member against external aggression such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10000-man Peninsula Shield force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is commanded by a Saudi general. Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market although the summit called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due to be held in Saudi Arabia next December. REUTER YA DYA DJG RTw  12/23 0835  GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT ABU DHABI Dec 23 Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-day annual summit on Wednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of three strategic Gulf islands as a condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf. A joint statement issued after the summit marked by relief over the settlement of a row between two Gulf Cooperation Council members also called for continued U.N. sanctions against Iraq. It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Council decisions following the expulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year. The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf common market but called on officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six members to the next summit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993. The statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf Arab states and Iran is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region's states. It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa which it shares with the United Arab Emirates and the continued occupation of the smaller islands the Greater and Lesser Tumbs. It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified Iranian measures which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on Iran to rescind those measures and end the occupation which it said was shaking peace and stability in the area. Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a small garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the UAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces continue to exercise their authority over the whole island. The UAE has seen this as virtual annexation. The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the UAE has since the Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general settlement. REUTER YA DYA DJG RTw  12/26 1441  IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS (Eds: updates with SNSC statement) NICOSIA Dec 26 Reuter - Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours on Saturday it was ready to defend militarily three disputed islands reminding them of its eight-year war with Iraq. Our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war) has proved to the world that our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and safeguard the territorial integrity of Iran Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) said. A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council voiced full support on Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands of Abu Musa Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb. The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings. Besides the UAE the GCC also groups Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani who chaired the SNSC's meeting on Saturday said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University: Iran is surely stronger than the likes of you. To reach these islands one has to cross a sea of blood. The SNSC quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA received in Cyprus also criticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as irresponsible. No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil said the SNSC. Earlier on Saturday the English language Tehran Times believed to be close to the Foreign Ministry said the UAE should be aware that Iran's self-restraint had certain limits. It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971 agreement to share Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied. The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrain from responding to the blows inflicted by them was childish Tehran Times said. IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement which urged Iran to reverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pull out of the two other islands. Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf have historically belonged to it. The dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa. REUTER AF JCH RTw  12/28 1011  TEHRAN PAPER WANTS IRAN REVIVE CLAIM TO BAHRAIN TEHRAN Dec 28 Reuter - Radical Iranian newspapers angered by Gulf Arab claims to three disputed islands are hitting back with demands that Tehran revive its claim to Bahrain and consider improving ties with Iraq. President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and senior officials strongly condemned a statement last week by leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) backing the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands. But the newspapers Salam and Jomhuri Eslami demanded that Tehran go further than restating its resolve to defend its sovereignty over the islands of Abu Musa Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb. It is not very clear why the Sheikh of Bahrain has joined the others Jomhuri Eslami said. The GCC groups Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the UAE. If historical records are to be the criterion the sheikh of Bahrain should go about his own business and the rule of Iranian people in Bahrain which belonged to Iran until 1970 should be re-established the paper said. It is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question of Iran's sovereignty over Bahrain...and start a serious and effective drive to end the separation of Bahrain from Iran it added. The late Shah of Iran relinquished Iran's claim to Bahrain in 1970 a year before the island became an independent state. Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution have carefully avoided raising the Bahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press during periods of tension with conservative Arab states across the Gulf. Salam newspaper said the GCC stand showed that the policy of appeasing pro-Western Gulf Arab rulers had backfired. No matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast of the Persian Gulf it is the United States and the West which speak the last word it said. They (the sheikhs) are nobody Salam said adding that Iran should revise its policy towards its neighbours especially its former war enemy Iraq. Disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties with Iraq...and going along with some Saudi-backed trends among the Iraqi opposition have played a role in the formation of the current situation the paper said. Ties between Iran and Iraq which fought a war from 1980 to 1988 improved briefly after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. But Tehran which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in the ensuing war again called for President Saddam Hussein's overthrow when he suppressed a Shi'ite Moslem revolt which swept southern Iraq after his 1991 defeat in Kuwait.

ED> (Menachem Begin Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to ED> the Knesset ED> quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk 'Begin and the Beasts New ED> Statesman 25 June 1982) Since you inserted the words 'The Palestinians are' we cannot know what Begin was talking about.

ED> Both the process of expropriation [of the Palestinians] ED> and the removal of the poor must be carried out ED> discreetly and circumspectly. ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl The Complete Diaries Herzl Press ED> 1960 I. p.88) Herzl died eighty nine years ago.  Are you suggesting that he has stated what is Israel's policy today?  Have you ever seen Israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-Jews let alone actually try to remove non-Jews from Israel?  If you actually believe that this quote has anything to do with Israel's non- Jewish citizenry today you are an idiot.  But if you realize that Israel has no intention of removing non-Jewish Israelis then you are nothing but a common liar.  This one time I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you are stupid.

ED> [Jews] must expel Arabs and take their place ED> (David Ben Gurion 1937 quoted in Shabtai Teveth Ben ED> Gurion and the Palestine Arabs Oxford University Press ED> 1985 p. 89) Did he say 'Jews' or did you add this?

And by doing so you are misleading people into believing that Ben Gurion who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands at the encouragement of people such as KING ABDULLAH and the MUFTI OF JERUSALEM was gloating over people abandoning their homes.

Although I don't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily I disagree. Any discrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the sole qualification for religious membership is racial. This is not the case for Israel although it might get a little closer than say Islam. This of course raises the vexed question of Church AntiSemitism. Jews have been heavily discriminated against on the grounds of religion in many Christian countries. If we take Russia as an example Jews were seriously persecuted but that persecution in the eyes of the Church and State stopped at the baptismal font. Officially anyway. If a Jew converted there were no legal barriers in his way (that I know of anyway.) Peter the Great's Interior Minister came from such a convert background. Can we then claim that the Russian Orthodox did not teach AntiSemitism and was not AntiSemitic? Similarly for the Roman Catholic Church? I suspect so as this is not a racial 'taint' but one based on belief and AS is after all a form of racism. Well maybe not. What is AntiSemitism then if not something racially based? I wonder if Hitler killed converts of 'pure' German blood. Does anyone know one way or the other?

On page 48 of this Turkish-suggested reference under sub-title Deportation and Massacre of Turkish Armenians it states: Several authors assert that Armenian resistance at Van constituted a key factor in the Turkish evacuation of Persia and motivated the Ittihadist [Young Turk] leaders to annihilate the Turkish Armenians. The question of responsibility for the massacres or deportation of nearly all Ottoman Armenians has evolved into a polemic. Hundreds of books articles and documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence and death. Many writers such as the British Bryce and Toynbee French Pinon German Lepsius American Morganthau and Gibbons have insisted that the massacres were predetermined and ruthlessly executed. The have refuted the Ottoman government's official publications and justifications by substantiating that anti-Armenian measures were deliberated by the Ittihadists even before the outbreak of war. The fact remains than an estimated eight hundred thousand to over a million Armenians perished within a few months and several hundred thousand more succumbed in the following years to the ravages of disease famine and refugee life. Unknown numbers of women and children were converted forcibly to Islam possessed by Turkish men or adopted by Moslem families. [(*][4] Shaw S. J.

For example: Experts from an interview (in Greek) with Professor Spyros Vryonis (from NYC's National Herald 3/12/93) [Thanks Mr. G.B.] Few people know of the problem I faced at UCLA when Professor Stanford Shaw was due for promotion. I knew him to be Turkey's man; due to my reading knowledge of Turkish and my seniority over him I was a member of the promotion committee. For that case I sat down and read his entire treatise History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey. It took me three months and I found out from volume I that he had plagiarized Uzun Jarsoglu an eminent Turkish specialist on Ottoman history. Shaw himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome of a 20-year search through the Ottoman Archives. Well I went on leave and managed to show 40% of Volume I containing around 5000 sentences to be the result of plagiarism matching each sentence with passages from the original work. He had even reproduced the errors. So I produced a 500-pages manuscript and submitted a 60-pages report on Shaw's plagiarism. The University however rejected my report and after a closed meeting promoted Stanford Shaw to Distinguished Professor. I paid a price for all this: upset by the whole process I confronted the entire University structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman. I asked for permission to run a seminar on Shaw's book that was denied by the President of the University. While the Center for Near Eastern Studies granted me permission the President was depriving me of my academic freedom. Luckily the Dean refused to give in and I did run the seminar attended by more than 150 academic people in which I uncovered Stanford Shaw who refused to attend. As a punishment the University froze all my raises. [5] Gochnak (Armenian newspaper published in the United States) May 24 1915. No chance!

Biden's statement were quoted by the Washington Post today: Let me put it plainly Mr. Secretary.  You are required to speak diplomatically; I am not.  I cannot even begin to express to you my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian victory. ... What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference timidity self-delusion and hypocrisy. ... After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia they are asking us to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe havens' for the Bosnians... Let's not mince words.  European policy is based on cultural and religious indifference if not bigotry.  And I think it's fair to say that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims were doing what the Serbs have done if this was Muslim aggression instead of Serbian aggression. Too bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence which pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger within the Islamic world the consequences of which we cannot begin to predict.  Later Biden told a reporter why he spoke out: I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear this is a big deal... so they will understand. and it IS a big deal.  By refusing the fundamental human right of self-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina Europe and the world have aided the Serbian aggression.  Moreover the arms embargo has forced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have 10 times more heavy weaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined.  Under such conditions it is very easy for Serbs to play a divide-and-conquer game and to get the Muslims and Croats (who have strong common interests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression) to start fighting each other which leads to their mutual catastrophe. One final quote:  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has said in Rome last week that In practice the embargo had the opposite effect intended.  It made aggression certain. All diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace while enforcing a 10:1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributed to this tragedy. Sincerely -Josip

Then there was John Major the architect of the betrayal of Bosnian Muslims to genocide.

The fact is >that the Croat govt. using their secret police (called the Ustache I think) >were the prime agents of the Nazis in Yugoslavia against the Serbs. > Actually just after the FIRST world war many Muslims were killed by Serbs. Under Serbian-led regime between the two world wars many Croats were also killed (especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan. 6 1929). Some Croats formed a resistance movement Ustashas (Insurgents) and were forced into exile to fascist Italy which sheltered them.  In exile they practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia; while Croats in Croatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership of Vladko Macek.  After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world war Vladko Macek refused to collaborate so Ustashas were brought in to run the newly formed puppet state.  This state included both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats (flowers of Croatian people).  Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina therefore joined Ustashas.  However even more others did not; they joined Tito's Partisans.    The Ustashas membership peaked at less than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time. After WWII Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended from Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago.  But in 1968 it was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality as either Serbs or Croats is not a good policy.  Dobrica Cosic the current president of the rump Yugoslavia was strongly opposed and sought to prevent the category Muslim (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on the next census.  He was criticized and expelled from the party.  So since that time Bosnian Muslims are considered a separate nationality although some still deny this and insist that they choose either Serb or Croat nationality. Sincerely Josip
2,My recollection of History/Documentary books is slitely different. It is my understanding that Croats were allies of Germany during WWII while Serbs had sided with Russia.  As a result Serbs did take a beating from Croats (NOT Bosnian Moslems) while Germany had the upper hand. Even today Russians consider/call Serbs as their Slovac brothers. This is one of the issues involved in the U.N.'s lack of active intervention against Serbs. As for the Bosnian Moslems I have not heard of any alliance with Germany or Russia in recent history.  Therefore I am curious if they did or were able to treat other parties in this conflict with same brutallity (as they are getting it today) in the past history. Regards; Ramin Moshiri

For me religion is just another piece in what constitutes the cultural identity of the Jewish people. I believe that as a people with a cultural identity they constitute a Nation and have the same right as any other people in the world to have their own State. The same right as the Armenians have as the Palestinians have as the French have and as anybody else have.

2,THE ENEMY WITHIN ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ By Robert I. Friedman The Village Voice May 11 1993 Vol. XXXVIII No. 19 | How The  Anti-Defamation League  Turned the Notion | | of Human Rights on Its Head Spying  on  Progress- | | ives and  Funneling Information to Law Enforcement | Roy Bullock wanted to be a spy since he was a teenager in Indiana and read I Led Three Lives Herbert Philbrick's Cold War saga of penetrating the Communist Party for the FBI.  Philbrick had become an American folk hero in the 1950s for building dossiers on unsuspecting colleagues.  It was a time when Hollywood produced more than 30 films portraying the informer as the quintessential American patriot.  In Boston where Philbrick led three lives as an FBI informant Communist Party member and private citizen the mayor even proclaimed a Herbert Philbrick Day and presented the spy with a plaque. For Bullock a shy young man who was coming to terms with his homosexuality in the straight-arrow '50s the life of a double agent was the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the Communist menace. I was fascinated with Herbert Philbrick Bullock recently told federal investigators and so I thought I would try to infiltrate the Communist Part.  In 1957 I went to the Sixth World Youth and Student Festival in Moscow with the American delegation.  I gave them [the FBI a full report on it when I returned along with some photos I took of some Soviet military vehicles. Bullock was hooked.  For the next two years he worked as an unpaid informant for the FBI.  But he found his true calling when he became a paid spy for the Anti-Defamation League in 1960.  Now his activities are at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent American history -- a scandal that may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Francisco. Over a 30-year period he compiled computer files for the ADL on 9876 individuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes including the NAACP the Rainbow Coalition ACLU the American Indian Movement the Center for Investigative Reporting Pacifica ACT UP Palestinian and Arab groups Sandinista solidarity groups Americans for Peace Now and anti-apartheid organizations.  Bullock who even spied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani when he visited the Bay Area in April 1991 sold many of his ADL files on anti-apartheid activists to South African intelligence.  Meanwhile between 1985 and 1993 the ADL paid him nearly $170000 using a prominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its financial relationship with Bullock. Last month police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco as well as Bullock's home confiscating computer files and boxes of documents.  According to court records Bullock's files contained the driver's license and vehicle registration information in addition to criminal histories on individuals -- much of which was allegedly stolen from the FBI and police computers.  Bullock 58 told the FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base had been given to the San Francisco ADL office.  Based on the evidence says Inspector Ron Roth in a police affidavit I believe that Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying them with confidential criminal and DMV information. What's more the San Francisco D.A. is investigating Bullock for tapping phones accessing answering machines and assuming false identities to infiltrate organizations.  Documents seized from Bullock's home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Area trash cans: He had the names and phone numbers of employees at the Christic Institute in San Francisco as well as telephone message slips to staff members (including names and phone numbers of callers) office correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the senders and inter-office memos.  He also had receipts from Christic Institute's bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings as well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees the dates and amounts.  Bullock even knew the balance in the Christic Institute's checking account. Investigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealed that the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering material with Israeli government officials.  What's more Israel apparently used tips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled there. *     *     * The ADL was established in New York City in 1913 to defend Jews and later other minority groups from discrimination.  It led the fight against racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party and in the 1960s championed the civil rights movement. But there was also a darker side.  In the late 1940s the ADL spied on leftists and Communists and shared investigative files with the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the FBI.  The ADL swung sharply to the right during the Reagan administration becoming a bastion of neoconservatism.  To Irwin Suall a repentant Trotskyite who heads the ADL's powerful Fact Finding Department the real danger to Jews is posed not by the right -- but by a coalition of leftists blacks and Arabs who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in America as well as the state of Israel.  In the tradition of his ideological soulmate William Casey Suall directed the ADL's vast network of informants who were given code names like Scumbag Ironside and -- for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta -- Flipper. For years journalists and liberal members of the Jewish community knew the ADL spied on right-wing hate groups.  As long as the targets were anti-Semitic organizations like the Liberty Lobby and Lyndon Larouche no one seemed to be particularly troubled.  But the Bullock case reveals that the ADL also spied on groups that have a nonviolent and progressive orientation.  This apparent massive violation of civil liberties may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Francisco where the investigation began.  The human rights group faces possible criminal prosecution on as many as 48 felony counts including an indictment for gaining illegal access to police computers.  Says one source close to the West Coast investigation It is 99 per cent certain that the ADL will be indicted. In the wake of the San Francisco investigation police probes of ADL spying are spreading to other parts of the country.  We have received numerous complaints about ADL [spying] says Sam Adams a spokesperson for the mayor's office in Portland Oregon. On April 16 the Harlem-based Black United Fund of New York and African American self-help group that Bullock allegedly spied on wrote District Attorney Robert Morgenthau requesting an immediate investigation of the ADL.  The ADL's actions cause great concern as it is a direct and flagrant violation -- at minimum -- of our civil rights....We call upon you to join with the District Attorney of San Francisco to...bring and end to this latest form of McCarthyism. Gerald McKelvey a spokesperson for Morgenthau's office says We have no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation. McKelvey adds that Morgenthau offered to assist the FBI and the San Francisco D.A.'s office on their pending investigation.  They have not so far asked for our assistance. The ADL acknowledges sharing information on violence-prone groups with law enforcement officials.  It also admits to maintaining extensive files on a wide variety of organizations but says in a two-page press release The vast majority of ADL's files are composed of news clips magazine articles books journals and other documents.... ADL has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance violations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency and the process by which the League gathers information is presently under review to insure that no laws are being violated. That's what the ADL says for public consumption.  But morale is so low that its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits.  And even as other Jewish groups circle the wagons around the ADL in a show of solidarity many do so holding their noses.  More than a few Jewish officials privately say the ADL has to decide whether it is a human rights group or a secret police agency. The ADL is regarded both inside the Jewish community and outside the Jewish community as the definitive source of information on anti- Semitism and extremist groups says Daniel Levitas the former executive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal an Atlanta- based group that monitors anti-Semitism racism and hate groups. One of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely tainted the ADL's credibility and reputation with regard to its objectivity.  This scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the Jewish community at large because people regard the ADL as synonymous with American Jewry. *     *     * Bullock's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well with the ADL's Cold War worldview.  In 1960 he moved to Southern California where he became an ADL spy for $75.00 a week.  Bullock almost always used his real name when snooping although he once called himself Elmer Fink when corresponding with supporters of Alabama governor George Wallace.  Bullock provided the ADL's office in Los Angeles with written reports which were transmitted to Fact Finding Department head Irwin Suall according to court records. Under Suall's stewardship Fact Finding Department had become the ADL's heart and soul.  Located at ADL national headquarters across from the United Nations the department had assembled a vast library on hate groups culling material from publications speeches and informants reports. Bullock was more than adept at leading a double life.  Not long after moving to California he ingratiated himself with a woman in the John Birch Society who helped him gain access to the group's Boston office. There he found a file the right-wingers were keeping on the ADL.  The discovery gave rise to speculation in the ADL New York office that they had somehow been penetrated by the Birchers. Bullock focused almost exclusively on right-wing extremist groups until the early 1970s when ADL L.A. head Milton Sinn was replaced by Harvey Schechter who encouraged him to target the left as well.  A few years later Bullock moved to the Castro District in San Francisco where he posed as an art dealer.  And ADL fact finder who had infiltrated the local Arab community had just been exposed.  When the ensuing scandal died down Bullock was ordered by the ADL to penetrate the Arabs. The ADL was especially concerned about the American-Arab Anti- Discrimination Committee founded by the former South Dakota senator James Abourezk to combat Arab-bashing.  In a page out of the CIA's dirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization Bullock joined the ADC and then recruited Nazis into the group apparently trying to discredit it according to published reports. In 1987 the ADL sent Bullock to attend the National Association of Arab Americans annual congress in Washington.  According to court documents Bullock was told to find the source of the group's funds. Bullock was unable to follow the money.  But he did such a good job at ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a NAAA delegation that visited Congress member Nancy Pelosi. It's not surprising that the ADL penetrated Arab organizations.  But only acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like ACT UP.  As far as Bullock was concerned gay groups in San Francisco were heavily infiltrated by what he called gay left revolutionaries prompting him to write about their activities for the ADL. Bullock soon expanded his horizons moving into the shadowy realm of foreign espionage after Richard Hirschhaut the head of ADL's San Francisco office introduced him to Thomas Gerard in 1986.  Gerard was then a detective with the San Francisco Police Department's Intelligence Unit.  Gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the CIA in El Salvador in the early 1980s where he apparently had more than a passing interest in right-wing death squads.  (Police searching Gerard's briefcase found extensive CIA literature about torture and interrogation photos of blindfolded and chained men as well as passports made out to Gerard in 10 different names including Thomas Clouseau.  From a remote jungle island redoubt in the Philippines where he fled last November Gerard told the Los Angeles Times that he will blow the lid off the CIA's involvement with Latin American death squads if he is indicted in the ADL spy case.) After their very first encounter in the ADL office Gerard and Bullock had lunch at McDonald's I liked Tom right off Bullock later told a San Francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation was obtained by the _Voice_.  Tom is a very charming roguish character with a great deal of integrity.  Let me say here I consider Tom Gerard one of the finest policemen I've ever worked with absolutely.  Honest capable intelligent and 100 percent American. Before long Bullock was providing Gerard with confidential ADL reports on various groups and individuals.  In turn Gerard gave Bullock classified police intelligence files on local Arab Americans skinheads and others.  Bullock told the FBI that Gerard's material ended up in his ADL reports.  I would say 99 percent of the data that I got was name address and sometimes physical description.  Criminal history very rarely Bullock told investigators.  Gerard also gave Bullock a chart that outlined a vast network of Bay Area Arab American businessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to Middle East terror groups as well as surveillance photos of Arab Americans receiving weapons training overseas.  Bullock claims that U.S. Customs in New York gave Gerard the photos.  It was understood that Bullock would be very careful with what he did with the information Gerard gave him and that Bullock would n

They can take their forces which are incomponent and ineffective at the first place.  And let whoever are willing to do the job what it takes.

How anyone can defend this UN force who are just watching the shelling on cities and towns everyday?  How anyone can defend and say those stinking UN forces being effective when Bosnian had almost 14000 children casualties between 5-14 age groups?  I think talking about the current UN forces to Bosnian muslims is just an insult to their casualties. I think Senator Biden said it all what has to be said on this issue. Europe is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this world.  Like Biden said they are the bigots when it comes to cultural difference and minorty closer to their home. Because they get rid of their minorities long long time ago starting in 15th centuries.  And they let Adolph to take care of the rest in 20th Century.  But he was much more naughty than they expected because he dared to step many toes.  So why spoil the good thing now when Serbs doing today what they were thinking the same yesterday. C. Akgun

The local elections in Hebron that the PLO was expected to win (perhaps adding a bit to its flagging position of legitimacy in the eyes of Palestinians and the Middle East) have been disrupted by Hamas actions overtly directed towards undermining those (and all West Bank) elections. The present ruling Israeli Labor coalition seems to be one rather thin political ice. The Palestinian delegation has been reduced from 14 to three to protest Israel lack of seriousness in the talks and refusal to reverse all the deportations immediately. Hopefully however each of the parties will begin to learn that just the fact that negotiations are taking place *does not mean* they are giving anything away to the other side (which was/is the favorite argument of the rejectionists).

This is not a fresh case of I don't have the faintest idea what literature it is to which you refer. Is this an explicit statement by some document? Or is it your interpretation of statements in such literature? Or is this a figment of your imagination or a Nazi Armenian propaganda movie script? In any case a fascinating piece of analysis. Here are the facts: Source: Walker Christopher: Armenia: The Survival of a Nation. New York (St. Martin's Press) 1980. This generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information of direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust: a) Dro (the butcher) the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the architect of the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims the most respected of Nazi Armenian leaders established an Armenian Provisional Republic in Berlin during World War II; b) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social theories of the Nazis declared themselves and all Armenians to be members of the Aryan 'Super-Race;' c) they published an Anti-Semitic racist journal thereby aligning themselves with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and d) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30000 members which fought side by side with the Wehrmacht. In fact by 1942 Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast network of pro-German collaborators that extended over two continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record' November 1 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In 1941 while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943 this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 30000-strong under the command of Dro (the butcher) who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination of the Jews. This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encore performance staged by the Armenians during WWI when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army.

The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and independence they have always been subservient and engaged in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet Armenia before and during World War I and fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during World War II. Belligerence genocide back-stabbing rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal they tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds before and during World War I. And the justice is long overdue. Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents and Nazi Armenian parents? Not a chance. As early as 1934 K. S. Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians 'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1] At that time he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslim population of Eastern Anatolia. However extreme rightwing ideological tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1936 for example O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted in the 'Hairenik Weekly:' The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall see that races due to their innate force have created the nations and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race. On the other hand Russia is comparatively weak because she is bereft of social sanctities.[2] [1] K. S. Papazian 'Patriotism Perverted' (Boston Baikar Press 1934) Preface. [2] 'Hairenik Weekly' Friday April 10 1936 'The Race is our Refuge' by O. Zarmooni. In April 1942 Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian Paikhar son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku. Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler asking for German support to his Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the creation of an Armenian SS formation in order to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the spirit of the Nazi ideas. He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2] [1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen) p. 106. [2] Enno Meyer A. J. Berkian 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax 900 Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen' (Heinz Holzberg Verlag-Oldenburg 1988) pp. 124 and 129. The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any official position. His views were represented by his men in the respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942. Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after a long conversation asked if he could visit POW camp close to Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not 'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy. As such they were subject to German racism. However Armenians were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August 1933 Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs. [1] Meyer Berkian ibid. pp. 112-113. Need I go on?

Source: The Times 2 March 1992 CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO INVESTIGATE THE MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS... As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw the scattered corpses. Apparently the refugees had been shot down as they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over shown to journalists afterwards showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts of the hills. The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly seized by Armenians last week. A further 4000 are believed to be wounded frozen to death or missing... Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there was a thump against the underside of the aircraft a red flash of tracer ripped past the starboard wing and the helicopter rocked sharply. We swung round and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire. We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round again tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads the helicopter swung round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired repeated blasts. Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh to pick up some of the dead. We had in fact been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window its cannons firing but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on our side. Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission. Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary. The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani official told us that there were now five former Soviet military helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. They have signed contracts to fly for us he said. The helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian pilot but fighting for the Armenians. We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield an heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh a sheer white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four corpses and it was during this and a previous mission that an Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed. Back at the airfield in Agdam we took a look the bodies the civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were covered with blood their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis. They had been shot. What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy our close shave and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN POLITELY DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

The atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time against the Muslim population within the Armenian Republic have been confirmed with very accurate information and the observations made by Rawlinson the British representative in Erzurum have confirmed that these atrocities are being committed by the Armenians. The United States delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers hungry and miserable their children and wives their properties destroyed and the delegation was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people. When it was hoped that this operation would end unfortunately since the beginning of February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region of Shuraghel Akpazar Zarshad and Childir have increased. According to documented information 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the aforementioned region more than 2000 people have been slaughtered many possessions and livestock have been seized young Muslim women have been taken to Kars and Gumru thousands of women and children who were able to flee their villages were beaten raped and massacred in the mountains and this aggression against the properties lives chastity and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities committed by the Armenians that the possessions taken from the Muslims be returned and that indemnities be paid that the properties lives and honour of the Muslims be protected.

Third-worldist and Islamic brain-rot has made it impossible for him to acquire and analyze facts appropriately. The history of the efforts of the Mufti of Jerusalem to serve the Nazis in the South Balkans and set up Muslim SS Divisions is well-documented.  In general Nazism and the leader-principle resonated well among Muslim peoples.  Khomeini's concept of the faqih is a recent example of such resonance.  In fact totalitarianism is etymologically a reasonable translation Islam. To be fair the Mufti did not succeed in getting large numbers of Muslims to join the SS.  But the rather small Muslim SS unit did manage to commit attrocities disproportionate to it size.  There were also Muslim people who were less than enthusiastic about the attempt of Muslim leaders to entice Muslim people to serve the Nazi cause actively.  And the Turkish government ignored practically all Nazi overtures even though an alliance with the Nazis against the Soviet government would have made a great deal of tactical sense.

According to the CBO the United States has a force of about 88000 US Army personel in Europe I do not know if this includes a USMC division in Norway.

At one time the US maintained 1500 MBTs {about half were M1A1} but some of these were relocated to the Persian Gulf.  I know the US has at LEAST one aircraft carrier battle group nearby and probably a marine assault brigade.  Does anyone know if there are any B-52/B-1Bs in England? The point is although there are no US ground troops in Bosnia it is not true that that all the american forces are safely camped outside of St. Louis. I also understand that the administration is planning to position troops in Macedonia.  Any reaction out there to this? Question:  day before yesterday I heard that Serbia & Montenegro had imposed additional trade sanctions against the Bosnian Serb Rebels. This morning a NPR reported at a bridge on the Drina (sp?) verified that only a bread truck was allowed to pass through to Bosnia. A Serbian {who happened to be muslim} stated that just a few months ago no vehicle even slowed for the boarder station. Now everyone is stopped and searched many are turned back.

Obviously Clinton is again trying to make policy for image purposes in America rather than to try to deal with the real problem and assume a share of responsibility for the problem.  He obviously didn't even consult with the Macedonians...he was just looking at the map of the former Yugoslavia for the safest place to put American troops so he could say to the Europeans...hey look we have troops on the ground in the former Yugoslavia too...now let me bomb so I can make it look like I am doing something in the American media. The problem is that the blue berets in Bosnia are dead meat if Clinton starts bombing but Clinton doesn't have the courage to ask that the blue berets leave because then he becomes primarily responsible to the Bosnian policy of the UN and the allies. Clinton wants to have his cake and eat it too...he wants to feel free to use American military power for the sake of domestic US politics and his domestic image but he doesn't want to assume the primary international leadership role in the UN and among the allies like Bush for all his faults did in the Gulf War... because with leadership comes responsibility and Clinton seems to want to retain the Europeans as scapegoats.

2,Let me remind all of those Muslim-haters out there who like to mention the Mufti's cooperation with Germany as a reason to let Muslims be slaughtered everywhere in the world of the following facts: 1)Why blame the Muslims for what the Nazis did and FORGIVE ITALY THE CROATS AND MANY OTHER EUROPEANS FOR BEING REAL ALLIES TO HITLER? 2)Why blame Muslims for supporting Germany the enemy of their enemy at the time (Britain who colonized most of the middle east and was responsible for most atrocities against Muslims in the region) and FORGIVE GERMANY ITSELF EVENTHOUGH IT IS THE ONE WHO CREATED NAZISM? 3)As far as Muslims are concerned : THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NAZI GERMANY AND ANTIMUSLIM COLONIALIST BRITAIN/FRANCE IN 1940. They were all racist anti-arab and full of arrogance and hate. WWII and the wars in ALgeria Sudan and other places proved that very clearly. Even anti- semitism was not more spread in Germany than in France or Britain it just happened to be official policy in Germany. And we will forgive you just set our countries free. So any arguments about WWII behaviour coming from the people who killed millions in that war (from either side) is just plain laughable. Enough said.

CAIRO Egypt (UPI) -- The Cairo-based Arab Organization for Human Rights (AOHR) Thursday welcomed the establishement last week of the Committee for Defense of Legal Rights in Saudi Arabia and said it was necessary to have such groups operating in all Arab countries. The London-based and Saudi-owned Al Sharq Al Awsat daily newspaper reported Thursday in a dispatch from Riyadh that the Higher Council of Ulema (Muslim scholars) on Wednesday had unanimously proclaimed the formation of the group illegitimate and unacceptable. In a statement issued in the Saudi capital the council Saudi Arabia's highest religious authority said it ``unanimously proclaims illegitimate the creation of this committee and the inadmissibility of endorsing it because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is guided by God's sharia (law) and the Islamic courts are widespread nationwide.'' The statement said no one in the kingdom is prevented from taking grievances to those courts or to other concerned authorities and that ``the authors of the bulletin (announcing the founding of the committee) are well aware of this.'' The council of 21 senior clergymen which ended its 40th session Tuesday under chairmanship of Sheikh Abdel Aziz Ben Baz warned that the formation of the group will have ``serious consequences'' but did not elaborate. ... >declarations and treaties protecting human rights particulalrly those >concerning discrimination against women.

In Bosnia  it is more or less used as an ethnic term not as religious one . There are people in Bosnia who refer to themselves as Christian Bosnian Muslims if you can make sense of that . Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims have the same language. Bosnian Muslims are mainly beleivers of Islam. I got this from Bosnian Muslim friend of mine who goes to University of Texas in Austin. jama

I wonder whether US or other countries would have risked themselves if only Jews were persecuted and Hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (I am no student of history and I am just asking questions.) If even for a moment you think that I am condoing ethnically motivated violence and killings you are dead wrong. Let me assure I am not. My only question is this: Do powerful countries have a moral obligation to interefere in other countries if their own interests are not threatened. I cite an essay by Charles Krauthammer in the Time (this week) that discusses this issue eloquently. For example did US and other European countries abandon their moral compunctions when they chose not to send military troops to Bombay when Hindus in a rare fit of impassioned rage killed many Muslims recently. I think not! Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious accusations of religious bigotry and such.

My reference is a 4 page essay in our local Star Tribute newspaper putting the whole conflict in perspective. I will readily admit that I am no authority in this area; however other posteers asserted that *some* Muslims did join hands with Croats and Nazis in persecuting Serbs. In any case past actions do not in any way validate or legitimize what is happending there now. I sincerely do apologize to the extent the author of the essay was wrong in making the assertion he made. Maybe some student of history may put this in perspective. Satya Prabhakar --

Actually the record of the Allies activities in the face of incontrovertible evidence as to what the Nazis (may they rot in hell) were doing clearly points to the conclusion that they would have done nothing.  The railways to the camps were not bombed despite the ease of doing so.  The US the place of refuge allowed in a bare pittance of Jews from Europe primarily for public relations so that the government could say it was doing something.  Many ships with refugees were turned away from US shores; some found refuge in Cuba or South America many others sunk or had to return to Europe (with predictable consequences).  The hope today is that we have collectively learned a lesson and are less complacent to ignore other countries' internal affairs.  The sad reality is that this does not seem to be the case. -- Sean Philip (Shlomo) Engelson Yale Department of Computer Science Box 2158 Yale Station New Haven CT 06520

No I'm not claiming 2000000 have been killed.  We are in the middle of the genocide process that Mr. Major has given yet another green light to.  Mladic seems to have most of what he wants but Boban is just getting his appetite whetted. Because Mladic refuses to allow international observers to inspect mass-grave sites and killing centers in places like Foca Brcko and Visegrad it will be years before we have an accurate account of the number killed. In practical terms it would be impossible to kill all 2000000.  There just isn't the kind of machinery of crematoria and gas chambers and transportation lines that the Nazis took 8 YEARS to develop.  And remember the Nazis killed minorities in the countries they occupied.  To actually kill 42% of the population requires extreme genocidal organization. But I do claim that the goal of the genocide is the systematic annihilation of Bosnian Muslim culture by killing as many as is feasible by rape by torture by the demolition of mosques libraries and culture artificts the burning and renaming of villages the shelling of civilians.  So that there won't be any of the 2000000 or so Muslims whose lives have not been shattered by the genocide though they still may be alive.

Let's let the Serbs massacre rape and ethnically clean 100000 Bosnians because we don't want our pretty blue berets there to get scratched.  Well I say get them the hell out of there if you're worried for them but don't deny Bosnians their basic right to self defense! Lift the embargo against Bosnia and let them defend themselves. What makes the UN troops more valuable than the Bosnian people?  They are letting the civilians die so the soldiers could survive when if anything it should be the other way around.  Idiots like Owen expect Bosnians to swallow a forced plan and just hope this problem will go away.  Well they're wrong.  If they had got their butts in gear (that is if Bosnia had oil) a year ago much of this could be prevented. Now however the results of this tragedy will last for generations. That's like forcing the jews to make peace with Hitler. Yeah right. This as senator Biden said reeks of bigotry and makes me and any decent human being for that matter quite sick.  It should be the Europeans not the Americans who take the inititiative and ask the other for support.  This is their backyard not the Americans. Today it's Bosnia tomorrow it will be Kosovo and Macedonia Greece and then Turkey and the damn thing will spread.  Not to mention European muslims who weren't even practicing before will rally to fundamentalism. Good luck handling that your majesty!  Owen was upset at the question which compared him to Chamberlain who hoped to appease Hitler.  He said that Chamberlain had been in Munich 2 years before any war I have been here during a blazing war for the last 18 months.  Well that makes him even worse because Chamberlain could have at least argued I'm giving Germany the benefit of the doubt whereas Owen can't even do that.  What the west is doing is aiding the Serbs by tying the Bosnians' hands and making the stupid excuse of their powerless troops on the ground who can't even protect the Bosnian foreign minister in their own armored vehicle and watch the killers just walk away!

What kind of civilization is this? >Clinton wants to leave the Europeans in charge and responsible >but wants to freelance on the side...and if his freelancing gets >too hot he wants to be able to cut and run...the American public may >be easily fooled...European leaders aren't.

Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity. They speak Serbo-Croatian. But there is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian and anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by changing religion.  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls the people (i.e. Christian slavs).  For this reason the war-criminals call all the Bosnian Muslims Turks even though they are not ethnically Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically identical but religiously other is called paradoxically ethnic cleansing rather than religious cleansing. Thus while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of WWII and older agenda the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from Bosnian is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.

In Bosnia Muslim is not merely a religious category but an ethnic one as well.  Actually here are the two contradictory arguments made by people on this subject: (1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality and Bosnian Muslims are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith. (2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel themselves to be Croats nor Serbs. In 1968 argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid and (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under Turkish rule centuries ago none of the present generation has any clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact although Bosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national allegiance most of them feel they have a separate cultural and historic identity.  So arguments like yes but your ancestors were Croats or Serbs carry very little weight.  Regardless of what their ancestors might have been as long as Bosnian Muslims feel that they are a separate national group that ends the debate. What outsiders say is simply not relevant. >the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle has >kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was >changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended! In the case of former Yugoslavia the date is 1971 when Muslim nationality appeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result of a sequence of decisions over the past decade from recognizing Bosniaks as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H) declaring that Muslims are a separate nation to formal endorsement of this in January 1969 and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of Muslim nationality choice in census forms. For comparison in 1948 census there were three national categories available to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina: Serb-Muslims:                        71991 Croat-Muslims:                       25295 Muslims ethnically undeclared:     788403 This clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own nationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat nationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have consistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose undeclared in 1953 they chose Yugoslavs in 1961 both Yugoslavs and Bosniak ethnic group and in 1971 1981 and 1991 they chose Muslim nationality. Perhaps the term Bosnian Muslim nationality is too confusing for the rest of the world.  But in the present context we ARE talking about Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some separate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and cultural.  Religion plays a smaller role as a part of culture in general because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political fanaticism yes; religious fanaticism no.  Group security and survival dominate people's thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact Bosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime. Sincerely -Josip

But I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda in fact for the past century or two Croats and Muslims have seen themselves as having a lot in common and they generally had friendly relations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong. To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply they are not separate peoples.  The events of the past two years clearly show Muslim determination to remain separate: in their alliance with Croats they maintained this separation.  Croats would have accepted a much closer relationship I think.  This century plus of building bridges between these two friendly peoples is now at risk because of the inexorable logic of war. Since Bosnian Serbs (32% of population) have 10 times more heavy weapons than Bosnian Muslims (44%) and Croats (17%) combined they have squeezed Muslims and Croats into only 30% of the territory. Muslims lost more territory than Croats (who built defenses early on). Under these conditions any alliance is bound to fall apart since it is easier to recover lost land from Croats than from Serbs. The only thing keeping this in check was the hope of reversal of fortunes through foreign military intervention and lifting of the arms embargo.  Since Warren Christopher had no luck persuading the Europeans to go along with this this hope was dashed.  Having no prospect of outside help the former allies turned on each other like two starved animals in a tight cage. This inexorable logic of course got plenty of help from Serbian intelligence operatives who were doing everything to build mistrust between Croats and Muslims for over a year.  A timely intervention to stop Serbian aggression would have prevented this. Sadly nothing was done to create a balance of power on the ground.  As long as the Serbs enjoy 10:1 advantage they can break any alliance even among friends.  This is tragic but hardly new: divide et impera was used by ancient Romans with success.  In my view Bosnian Muslims and Croats managed to resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until May 9 1993 when the hope of reversal of fortunes was lost. I have a question for the distinguished diplomats: do they believe Balkan peoples are experimental cannon fodder?  I'd like to know what did they expect when they decided to enforce the arms embargo which solidified Serbian 10:1 advantage in heavy weapons; how did they expect to prevent fragmentation of the Muslim and Croat defense forces;  and how on Earth do they hope to restore peace without justice? The implications of this immoral approach I cannot begin to predict but I am filled with foreboding... Sincerely Josip

In fact correct me if I am wrong Serbs are attacking Bosnians with their battle cries Death to the Turks!. Is this so shocking? Years of communism apparently suppressed their hatred and anger towards the Turks. But such hatred is obviously one that dies hard. Serbs must understand Turks are no longer the good old barbarians world has come to know by propaganda after propaganda. Serbs must further understand that barbarism does not work. Serbs must even further understand that barbarism would one day have to face counter-barbarism. So I urge those people [Serbs] to stop killing Bosnian women and children. And they must never forget that Turks in the motherland are watching...patiently. Cordially Erol Esen esen@mozart.cs.colostate.edu

Muslim in ex-Yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  In fact not all Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam.  Therefore there do (did?) exist in ex-Yugoslavia Christian Muslims.  Tito defined the Muslim nation constitutionally adding Muslims to Serbs Croats and Slovenes the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the end of WWI.  In addition Tito added two other nations constitutionally: Montenegrins and Makedonijans. Nations had the right of secession but republics did not.  So Muslim is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who differentiate between religion and politics that is) in B-H.  It was not a Christo-Slavic ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia it was the Atheist Communist ideology of Tito.  Before Tito there was no Muslim nation in Yugoslavia. The war is not a religious war and it is not an ethnic war.  It is a civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns instead of pens.  The Croat Muslim and Serb political leaders *all* chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements. -Nick

Terms of secession?  You are of course joking right Nick?  Nobody *chose* to fight.  Bosnia and Croatia were *internationally* recognized nations when the Serbs attacked and started on their well-documented genocide.  That makes them an outside aggressor.  It's a simple genocide a classical example of ethnic cleansing.  There is no question of civil war... -- Shakil

Some women and girls are kept as wives the others are shipped north where they perform forces labor on Kordofan (central Sudan) farms or are exproted notably to Libya it said.

2,May 13 1993  _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_ MOSCOW (UPI) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia's 7th army stationed in Armenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for allegedly carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers. A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey said the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal the Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported. But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment. This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes the statement reads. The five men together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar district of Azerbaijan between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan after which they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to carry out diversions against Azeri troops. However the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in the battle zone round Karabakh. Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes. Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed in these Caucasian republics who were left behind after the break-up of the Soviet Union are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war. The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men and to hand them over to the Russian authorities. It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey. Itar-tass said that the soldiers' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency. -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | Armenia has not learned a lesson in S.D.P.A.

In any case past actions do not And the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay from an unnamed source? You may indeed be confusing *some* Muslims with Nazi Armenians. Altogether 30000 Nazi Armenians served in various units in the German Wehrmacht according to Ara J. Berkian. 14000 in predominantly Armenian army units 6000 in German army units 8000 in various working units and 2000 in the Waffen-SS.[1] A number of these Nazi Armenians were volunteers from France Greece Rumania and Bulgaria who had chosen to commit themselves to the German war effort. Derounian says that Dashnag Armenians from France bore the mark 'Legion Armenienne.'[2] That Nazi Armenians like Dro 'the Butcher' and Nezhdeh sided with the Germans probably had an impact on the decision of Armenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service.

[2] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian) in 'The Armenian Displaced Persons' ibid. p. 19. In fall 1942 the Armenian infantry battalions 808 and 809 were formed to be followed by battalions 810 812 and 813 in spring 1943. In the second half of 1943 infantry battalions 814 815 and 816 were created. These battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units were attached to the infantry division 162. Also attached to ID 162 were the field battalions II/9 I/125 and I/198 which were formed between May 1942 and May 1943. Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the Nazi army if battalion II/73 which was not employed at any time is to be included.[1] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers. Armenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours red-blue-orange and the inscription 'Armenien.' [1] Joachim Hoffmann 'Dies Ostlegionen 1941-1943 Turkotataren Kaukasier und Wolgafinned im deutschen Heer' (Verlag Rombach Freiburg 1976) p. 172. While having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the Second World War Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler's defeat. They now backed Stalin's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces hoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim population would be exterminated. Stalin played on Armenian national sentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America for his imperial ambitions.[1] Stalin's ultimatum to the Turkish government led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine.

The reasons are pragmatic: even if >Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under >Turkish rule centuries ago none of the present generation has any >clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact although I am forced to disagree with you. First of all one may have been born from a non-Turkish non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land yet still can be a Turk provided this person calls himself or herself a Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature not a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying with the Turkish values. Secondly the following observations by Westerners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat: If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the nations which they brought under their power to which no one could have opposed today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody to worship in their own way centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries.[1] The Turks who are a conquering nation did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule; instead they respected their religions and traditions. It was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a Romanian nation today (Popescu Ciocanel). Turks rule over people under their administration only externally without interfering with their internal structures. On account of this the autonomy of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced European countries.[2] ...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too or if it did not keep translating itself into action many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves happy! (A. de Mortraye).[3] Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition. On the contrary it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens even today. In Turkey however if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities local courts immediately take them under their protection. In that vast and calm country of the sultan all religions and nations are living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue it does not replace them. Because of this the Catholic sect is more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this sect neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the dead are being taken to the graves a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the Eucharist celebrations chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of priests.

History shows that within the last 170 years Greeks played that game twice: They used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in 1822 to instigate the Morea rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the Muslim people.

Shaw 'The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic' New York University Press New York (1991). pages 202-203: <<In 1865 immediately after enactment of the new Organic Statute for the Jewish community and just as Jewish capital from Europe was beginning to have an effect in Istanbul local Armenians and Greeks started a pogrom against Jews immediately across the sea of Marmara at Haydarpasa terminus of the Anatolia railroad with three hundred Jews massacred and many more beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the Sultan sent his personal guard across the bay to protect the Jews [39]. In later years ritual murder attacks against Jews carried out mostly by native Greeks Armenians and in Arab provinces by Maronites and other Arab Christians often with the assistance of the local European consuls took place throughout the empire. There were literally thousands of incidents continuously until World War I in Southeastern Europe as far west and north as Monastir and Kavalla in Istanbul at Gallipoli and the Dardanelles at Salonica and in all the Arab provinces as far south as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians by word of mouth or published in their newspapers often by Christian financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia resulting in individual and mob attacks on Jews and the burning of their shops and homes. Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt and Syria it was usually the Greeks who led the way in many cases with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians whose Greek Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the rumors they could find regarding Jews evidently with the desire of instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt where their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule enabled them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with little question or opposition. On 20 June 1890 thus Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer) British High Commissioner in Egypt received the following report from David and Nissim Ades in Cairo: ''Sir I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews especially those (the issues) of the 14th 17th and 19th instant. Now Sir are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism Greeks Armenians etc. or is he to be allowed to continue to poison the people's minds with exaggeration and painted words? In an article he asserted that the Jews use Christian blood for Passover of course this has caused a deal of excitement.'' [40] Whenever Greek and other Orthodox religious authorities or prominent Greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence or reduce tension they invariably indicated their cooperation and then failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated or led them.

The official report mentioned by Lord Curzon is the report of British High Commissioner to Caucasia Sir Oliver Wardrop.

University of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles) 1967 p. 13. The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4700000 of whom 940000 (20 percent) were Armenian 1200000 (25 percent) Georgian and 2220000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group 1140000 were Tatars. Paradoxically barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd the administrative center of the province had only 44000 Armenians as compared to 68000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897 however the Armenians had established a scant majority 53 percent in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent or 670000 of the 1120000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic a solid block of 370000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia. (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of Transcaucasia). In 1920 '0' percent Turk. We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead. Ohanus Appressian Men Are Like That p. 202.

Let me improve this one for you then. For nearly one thousand years the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye. Today x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia. Today x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds. Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland. ...On this occasion we once again reiterate the unquestioned justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and... - We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide render reparations to the Muslim people and return the land to its rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an issue which cannot be delayed further and it is imperative that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed. - We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide adopts the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures to the contrary. - As taxpayers of the United States we express our vehement protest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued coddling protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet Armenia. - Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia's.

Start of Article (All commets in [*....*] are mine not Dr. Arens) [Comments in square brackets are mine - Yigal] >From The OTHER Front July 29 1992.  Translation of Ha'aretz article. Racism in the Knesset --------------------- Coalition requirements on one hand and the presence of progressive MKs from _Meretz_ in the coalition on the other have compelled Rabin and his friends to change to some extent their attitude towards the Arab public and their representatives in the Knesset.  Although he did refuse to view them as partners taking part in the coalition and joining the government he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document of intentions which included a commitment to work towards a decrease in the discrimination between Jewish and Arab citizens.  [Decrease WHAT?!?! But posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does not exist *at* *all*!  Is Rabin too a closet self-hater??? - Yigal]. However racism has not disappeared.  When the Knesset sat to consider who would staff its various committees a request was made to put an MK from Hadash [the Communist party one of the Arab parties - Yigal] on the State Comptroller's Committee.  And oh did that ever stir up a storm -- including in the ranks of Labor -- since many Knesset members find it unthinkable that an Arab MK sit on one of the important house committees.  Security secrets are liable to fall into their hands... This attitude -- which until recently had not even aroused criticism being so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people's hearts -- holds that there are Knesset members who despite having been elected by tens of thousands of votes are not entitled to be full partners in the body which represents the people of Israel.  We are not speaking here of political discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- but of racial discrimination.  The proof: one of the compromises proposed was that MK Mahamid [an Arab - Yigal] should be replaced by Tamar Gojanski [a Jew - Yigal] from the same party.  It was not the member's party which was considered unfit but his race... [* Here is a documented case in a respected Israeli newspaper. *] It is worth noting that for the first time since the state's founding a public debate has arisen on this subject as witness the following article: A TEST OF SELF-CONFIDENCE By Gid'on Levi Ha'aretz July 26 1992 Revelations of discrimination against Arabs have become such an integral part of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal with them.  [Do you hear that -----?  Please contact this Levi fellow and explain to him how little he knows about Israel.  Please! - Yigal]. Except that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government's window dressing and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious. Last week provided two more such examples: the Israeli Knesset is finding it very difficult to allow Arab representation on its more important committees; and Israel Television is finding it no less difficult to give a platform to Arabs from the territories.  Seemingly two entirely different matters but in fact they are one and the same. The 13th Knesset proved last week that even though one third of its members are new faces it has not renewed its own face at all at least on one issue.  Parliamentary traditions may be modernized and parliamentary traditions may become obsolete and only one tradition endures forever: no Arab shall set foot in the more important committees of the house.  There has never been and never will be an Arab MK on the External Affairs and Defense Committee or on the Finance Committee. Worlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not to give Arabs for the first time a place on the State Comptroller's Committee. The arguments are old and well-known: In all three of the above committees innumerable secrets are revealed -- and woe unto us if an Arab should hear them.  One must not make light of such arguments but their significance should also not be exaggerated.  Every Arab MK is not spending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over information from the Knesset committee room to Black Panther headquarters in Jenin; and not all the aforementioned committees are continually occupied in the discussion of top-secret matters which could safely be revealed for example to MKs supportive of the Jewish Underground but not to an Arab MK from the Likud Labor or even from Hadash. The Arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the Subcommittee on Secret Service Matters but what would happen one may ask if MK Nawaf Masalha were to hear God forbid a review of the Foreign Minister in an open meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee or even a review of the Army Chief of Staff which in any case are regularly leaked to the next edition of the news.  And what would happen if MK Hashem Mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at al-Najah? Their non-participation [in important committees] and that of their colleagues creates an intolerable situation where Arab members of the elected house have only semi-positions.  They are good enough for addressing plenary sessions and for voting for or against the government and participating in the deliberations of the Immigration and Absorption Committee.  But they must not for example participate in the process of formulating the state budget in the Finance Committee or in the allocation of resources to local authorities.  In any case they have little part in that. Labor's dependence on the support of the Arab parties has brought about some improvement: MK Hashem Mahamid will it seems participate in the State Comptroller's Committee.  Earlier there had been a ridiculous attempt made to dictate to Hadash who their representative should be and thus to prevent the Arab from entering this dubious holy-of-holies but it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional backing for such a step. But not to worry: even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices.  The new Committee Chair Roni Milo has already announced that he will set up subcommittees aplenty for his committee.  Thus he will decide where it is permissible for Mahamid to participate and where not.  A solution such as this could by the way also have been adopted for the rest of the committees thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from the Knesset.

2,It seems that to keep the peace talks going Israel has to keep making goodwill gesture after goodwill gesture while Palestinian Arabs continue to go around hunting Jews. If the peace talks are going to have any realistic chance of success the Arabs are going to have to start reciprocating especially since they are the ones who will be getting tangible concessions in return for giving up only intangibles.  If they keep trying to change the already agreed upon rules which seems to be one of their favorite games the Israelis are not likely to be very confident that the intangibles they will receive at the bargaining table will be worth the parchment they're written on. It takes two to negotiate a peace.  It's time for the Arabs to start doing their share. -- Alan H. Stein                     astein@israel.nysernet.org

Everything is so much cheaper when it happens to the Jews. BC> BC> Why? The double standard of human behavior regarding the Jews must be manitained. A perfect example is the outcry over the temporary removal of 400 men who advocated murdering Jews and destroying the State of Israel compared to the deafening silence over the abusive treatment of Jews in Arab countries during the past 50 years. Compare the tacit appoval that the world gives to Muslims who randomly murder Jewish civilians to the righteous indignation expressed if people in the occupied territories are kept from working in Israel in an effort to reduce these random murders from occuring while everyone knows that no country is at all required to accept foreign workers except Israel of course. Jewish blood has always been cheap.  The non-Jewish world ha never regarded any form of Jewish suffering important except when the Jews were the models of the powerless victim holding the high moral ground as it had been just after World War 2. However as soon as the Jewish people started to take care of themselves the ancient hatred of Jews was unleashed again. I doubt if the non-Jewish world is even capable of having any compassion towards Jews as anti-semitism is so ancient and so basic to both Christianity and Islam. Golda Meir said that there would be peace when the Arabs love their own children more than they hate the Jews.  And while I know that there are more Arab parents who love their children than those who would send their children out into the streets to throw rocks at men trained to defend themselves with guns the world is so obsessed by a hatred of Jews trying to defend themselves that they have yet to even question the actions of those parents who not simply allow their children to do this but encourage them to throw themselves into harm's way.  Even Arab children are expendable if their tragic deaths are used in the neverending propoganda battle to blame Israel and the Jews for any misfortune befalling Arabs in the middle east. *       *       *       *       *       *       * Who is a Jew?  A person whose integrity decays when unmoved by the knowledge of wrong done to other people.  -  A. J. Heschel

More than 2000000 residents of Croatia and B-H have *not* accepted the terms of secession which Tudjman and Izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon them.  Croats and Muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but they do not have a right to grab the *entire* territories of the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and B-H. Oh BTW *Yugoslavia* was *internationally recognized* when it was destroyed by Tudjman Izetbegovic Milosevic and the international community led by Germany.  If Yugoslavia's borders could be changed against its will then certainly Croatia's borders and B-H's borders can be changed as well. As I have stated many times: the civil war in ex-Yugoslavia will end when the terms of secession (borders etc.) for Croatia and B-H are finally agreed upon.  Serbs Croats and Muslims will *all* have to make territorial concessions to reach such an agreement. -Nick
2,In article <C6z32r.AH9@news2.cis.umn.edu> prabhak@giga.cs.umn.edu (Satya Prabhakar) writes: I guess that it was not acceptable because Germany *also* chose a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of other countries in peril. I wonder whether US or other countries would have risked themselves if only Jews were persecuted and Hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (I am no student of history and I am just asking questions.) I don't think they would have.  After all the U.S. was one of the countries that turned away Jewish refugees when there was still time to get them out.  (Considered and rejected at the Cabinet level then..) ... Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious accusations of religious bigotry and such. As I understand it International law provides the right of any country to intervene to prevent genocide.  I think once the World Court has ruled that genocide is being committed... If a Human Rights Czar is appointed at the U.N. we could have international monitors recording events and responses of local officials and develop an objective basis.  This could be backed by adjudication at the International Court of Justice and enforcement through a Rapid Deployment Force under the U.N. Secretary General's command.  I would like to see the U.N.  directly impose ICJ rulings whenever feasible (without the possibility of vetos at the UN Security Council.. much as the President can't veto a U.S. Supreme Court ruling). The U.S. is now supporting the effort to appoint the HR Czar -- the third world opposition is led by three countries China Iran and Pakistan (What company is Pakistan keeping!). The U.S. is also reconsidering its opposition to the U.N. force initially envisaged in the Charter (although under the control of the Security Council).  The UN SC is quite a flawed body.  Rogue governments like the PRC have even threatened their veto in the last few months to block the move to place U.N. troops in Bosnia under Chapter 7 instead of 11 (if I have the numbers straight) where they could have moved from being a monitoring to an enforcement force without requiring further SC action.  (The PRC even continues to threaten using its veto on U.N. action despite the ICJ ruling.  The current set-up requires the SC to enforce ICJ rulings..). Peace Gul Agha

Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order.  Correlate this with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections. Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas. Lo and behold you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of Arab candidates.  This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts between Israeli Arabs.  Some claim membership to right wing parties while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff. I worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections (not this last one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that were returned from the local delegates elected.  At the time the system was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there was no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates. |> Exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the Labour party |> has never put an Arab into a Cabinet post and insists its coalition |> members do the same?

Quite simply if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor party and voted they would be able to command more than %15 of the delegates.  This is a power base that can not be ignored! Especially when they are not ranked high in the party (once again due to lack of political power).  I have seen how the labor party works from the inside and my experience has been that as in most political situations the MKs act out of their own self-interest. And to answer your question I broke with labor because I felt that they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodox coalition members. |> >From The OTHER Front July 29 1992.

And rightly so. The author of this crap is a racist pure and simple. He obviously has no qualms about being open with it either unlike some other Arab- and Mulsim-bashers on the Net. Now I for one am not going to look at Joachim's posting and infer from it that all Jews think this way. Sure there might be some but this view is not a part of Judaism and it is stupid to believe that all Jews' minds are this twisted. However some Muslims might look at Joachim's flame as a reaffirmation of their worst fears about Jews: that they all hate Arabs and are racists. For this reason I am alarmed that not more Jews on the Net have spoken out against what Joachim has said. They have the chance to possibly change the anti-semitic views of some people on the net to show them that all Jews do *not* hate all Arabs and Muslims just like all Muslims do *not* hate all Jews. Yet they are missing that chance. Remember to many people silence implies consent.

Israel's #1 issue is Security so *any* outcomes of negotiation certainly need to address ISREAL'S perception of this issue. The problem is is defining (by outsiders by Israel and by the Arabs themselves) what is the #1 issue to the Arab side. Is it Palestinian statehood is it that Israel as a state should not and must not be allowed to exist is it that the existence of a self-governing non- muslim state in the Islamic World is intolerable...what? Just as the dividing line between Israel-fighting-for-security and Israel-fighting- to-expand is often hard to discern by outsiders (especially to the Arab world) so the rationale behind the Arab-struggle-to-undermine-Israel-in- any-way could either be based on visceral rejectionism or a sense of being wronged that still values peace who knows which.

[EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox [EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is [EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism [EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. The vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian Apostolic. There was however a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians in Cilicia closer to the Mediterranean in Adana Marash Aintab etc. [EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia [EE] did not speak any Armenian but used Turkish in their everyday lives. This is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in certain areas of Cilician Armenia most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact Turks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure most all Armenians especially men also knew Turkish in order to function in larger society. [EE] My question is given so many separations in the Armenian community what [EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian [EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated religion [EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn't even speak [EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the [EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian [EE] consciousness. The Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian regardless of the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian nationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later stages of WWI and after the genocide many Armenians who were converted to Islam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This practice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy of clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these converted Armenians ironically in order to stay alive were staunch Moslems. [EE] Any information will be appreciated. You answered your own question! The common thread throughout your inquiry was the word Armenian! [EE] Regards -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | Armenia has not learned a lesson in S.D.P.A.

First of all this is NOT a strife; this is a massacre of innocent Moslem poeples by the Christian West. Since Ottoman lost the control of Balkans many tens and hundereds of millions of Muslem peoples (Turks Albanians Bosnians and others) have been tortured raped massacred and driven out of their homes by the Cristians of both the region and Europe. Some lucky ones escaped to relative safety in Turkiye. The remaining others are being finished now by local Christians the USA and the rest of Europe. The Christian West is maintaining a tight arms ambargo on the Muslem peoples of Bosnia so they cannot deffend themslves while letting Christian Serbs and Croats torture rape and massacre the innocent Moslem peoples of Bosnia. It took Christian Europe for almost six centuries to achieve this objective of theirs and I do not think they will let it up. This will go on untill every single Moslem person (Bosnian Turk Albanian etc) is tortured raped massacred and driven out of their homes.

They are Pomaks and Gypsies. Oboy this is exciting. First you discuss your non-existent literature tastes then your fantasies and now your choices of historical revisionism. Are you related to 'Arromdians' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle? The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks' which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people whom all the three nations (Bulgarians Turks and Greeks) consider as part of themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized according to the agreements? It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091 virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority as state official. Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. Talk about democracy. The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic convention in Komotini. Such destruction which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' Greek Constitution which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments. The government of Greece on the other hand is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward Hellenizing the region. The longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been active until 1984. But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. This is also the final verdict (November 4 1987) of the Greek High Court. Helsinki Watch a well-known Human Rights group had been investigating the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990 their findings were published in a report titled 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.' The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in Komotini. Such destruction which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the Lausanne Convention. |1| HELSINKI WATCH: PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE Ankara (A.A)  In a 15-page report  of the Helsinki Watch  it is stated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being implemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end. The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the Turkish Minority in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify themselves as 'Turks'. NEWSPOT May 1992 |2| GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS The  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek state is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish minority with Turkey. Pointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is called Greek  by ethnic  definition only  the religion  of the minority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with the Greek  newspaper Ethnos he said:  I am a Greek  citizen of Turkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western Trace are also Turkish. Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in Western  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace. Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr. SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority Faikoglu said.  In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented Greece the cradle of democracy from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal rights. On Turco-Greek relations he pointed  out that both countries are predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by cooperating adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was will to improve relations with Greece. NEWSPOT January 1993 |3| MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE. Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS. Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine. Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  ENA  on  March  11  1992  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election. Bulev said in the interview: I am not Greek I am Macedonian. Sideropoulos said  in the  article that Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling. The  main  charge  against  the two  according  to  the  court summons  was   that  they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece). The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350000 to 1000000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian. In  1913  Greece   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500000 in Bulgaria; 150000 in Albania; and 300000 in Serbia proper. Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia) where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live. Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour the Republic of Macedonia. Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over. ================================================================ M. I. L.

It seems that terrorism against their own co-nationals has been a prominent part of the revolutionary activities of the Dashnag leaders of the Caucasus. Organized to fight the Turks these chieftains have been more successful in their fight against their Armenian opponents in Turkey and the Caucasus very often defenseless and innocent. p. 25. We were defeated. p. 38. The fact remains however that the leaders of the Turkish Armenian section of the Dashnagtzoutune did not carry out their promise of loyalty to the Turkish cause when the Turks entered the war...and a call was sent for Armenian volunteers to fight the Turks on the Caucasian front. p. 38. Thousands of Armenians from all over the world flocked to the standards of such famous fighters as Antranik Kery Dro etc. The Armenian volunteer regiments rendered valuable service to the Russian Army in the years of 1914-15-16. By the way here is the entire paragraph. We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead. Ohanus Appressian Men Are Like That p. 202.

The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina' or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument. The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.). 1. The monarch Dara said: I sent my servant to Arminam 'Armeniya'. 6. On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'. 7. To the country town of Zozo to Armaniya 'Armeniya'. According to Karakashian: As for 'Armenia' the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians this is more recent than the word 'Ararat' and is to be found used in the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'. Saint Martin: The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians as 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs as Ermeniyye. Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap' which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to a place as in Ararat Archish Aruyr Archar Arshav Arazen and Aror while 'men' is used to refer to spirit thought or human being and therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'. G. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary Haik is the diminutive form of Hai and that Hai is the name of our nation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word Armen that foreigners apply to our people.' It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name that 'Armen' is the name of the people who lived there and that these are in no way connected with the word 'Hai'. Haik and Haiastan: Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom the Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance between the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof and in any case no such theory appears before the time of Moses of Khoren. Haiasa: The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the region known as Armenia. Professor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite inscriptions for Upper Armenia.' Yensen in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is identical with the Hittite 'Hatio' in other words that 'Hai' is a Hittite word. Research however has proved this erroneous and shown that 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'. Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with no success. As for Greek there is no point in even mentioning it. The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious that we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'. Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai' 'Haikazan' and 'Haiastan' entered our older works. According to Karakashian: 'The word Haik is never to be found employed with reference to a leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren nor is it ever found employed in the forms Haika or Haykazn. Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he improved and developed Haiastan etc.). If the word had referred to a nation and had been derived from Hai or Haik they could also have used the words Haikak and Haykazn in a number of places.' According to Professor Sayce who deciphered a number of Hittite inscriptions: 'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality or species. The words Haddanas Haddina were used by the Assyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the d between the two a letters to y Hadinasdani was in this way transformed to Haiastan'. Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view but regards the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai' and 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds however that a solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa' which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards. Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case it seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The suffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa' which refers to the country of the 'Hayasas'. E. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people. The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic very dark above average height an Aissores Asian group with close ties with certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples. According to J. Deniker: From the philological point of view the Armenian and Kurds may be regarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region. They are almost always short-headed with skull measurements of 85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic family. Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows: The Armenians are a mixture of Semites Turk Kurds and Mongols but some of them display Armenian features e.g. height a little above average fair complexion dark hair dark eyes very often a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. Investigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a distinct race.

Will anybody A typical Armenian revisionist. As in the past in x-Soviet Armenia and today in Azerbaijan for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan which renders the Armenian claims preposterous even lunatic. No one in his or her mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event could have plagued the Azeris. One cannot even imagine the reverse case to occur for the Armenians either would have slaughtered the Azerbaijanis or put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. Where was she? An Appeal to Mankind During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter Universal Declaration of Human Rights Helsinki Agreements Human Problems International Forums documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated. The USSR's President government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace. The 140000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed hundreds of people killed thousands wounded. Some 200000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR their historical homeland. Together with them 64000 Russians and 22000 Kurds have also been driven out a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40000 Turkish-Meskhetians Lezghins and representatives of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations. One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR. We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated its territory culture  and history are trampled its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad and this defamation is spread over the whole world by Soviet mass media Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States. One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan. It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR. We are for a united indivisible sovereign Azerbaijan we are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade. But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the neighboring lands. The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent. But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion by their residence or other attributes? All people are brothers and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins. THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR PAINFUL SEARCH .. THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh. The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates. The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2000 dead. The State Prosecuter Aydin Rasulov  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  Hojali Disaster said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence. FranCois Zen  Ruffinen head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali most  of  them  civilians. We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy Mr Zen Ruffinen said. We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead. Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office. Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990. Those  nationalists the  Popular  Front finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia fell to the Armenians. Officially 184 people have so  far been certified as dead being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. This  is just a small percentage of the dead said Rafiq Youssifov the republic's chief forensic scientist. They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours. Of these 184 people 51 were women and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation including ears  noses breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed Mr Rasulov said. Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here six policemen there  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February. There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot. People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return. There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces. THE INDEPENDENT London 12/6/'92 HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago writes Hugh Pope. I'm still  wearing the same  clothes I don't have  any others the  51-year-old carpenter  said  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. I was wounded in five places but I am lucky to be alive. Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food without electricity for more than a month and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2000 to  3000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh. At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons  artillery  heavy machine-guns the lot Mr Sadikov said. Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town  down a hill through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side. To escape the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak. None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire Mr Sadikov said. Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died  including  his 67-year-old elder brother. I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat he said pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. We have never got any of the bodies back. The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation Alif  Hajief was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing Mr Sadikov said. Another hero  Elman Memmedov the  mayor of Hojali said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee. The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going Mr Sadikov said. I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock. Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

You make it sound like these guys are angels Ilyess.  (In your clarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???) Friday's New York Times reported that this group definitely is more conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who think that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively enough).  The NYT reported that besides complaining that the government was not conservative enough they have: - asserted that the (approx. 500000) Shiites in the Kingdom are apostates a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law brings the death penalty. Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin) isn't he Ilyess? - called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who drove in public a while back to protest the ban on women driving.  The guy from the group who said this Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri said that these women should be fired from their jobs jailed and branded as prostitutes. Is this what you want to see happen Ilyess?  I've heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving has no basis in the Qur'an the ahadith etc. Yet these folks not only like the ban they want these women falsely called prostitutes? If I were you I'd choose my heroes wisely Ilyess not just reflexively rally behind anyone who hates anyone you hate. - say that women should not be allowed to work. - say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom. Now the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government on earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot among other things.  I just think that the most likely replacements for them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country. But I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the last six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing by the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women not fully veiled (something stupid for women to do IMO because it sends the wrong signals about your morality).  And I've read that they've cracked down on the few home-based expartiate religious gatherings and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapers offering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who dare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So the government has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of the wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition. As unislamic as some of these things are they're just a small taste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of Saud like they're trying to in the long run.

2,I always believed the statement 'those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it (Will Durant ?) but I am beginning to believe the opposite is true. Here in t.p.m and in other newsgroups it seems that history is mainly remembered to foment hatred or to be used as a club. In the history of my own people there are ample acts of shame both done by my people and done to my people. Since I was not party to any of those acts I refuse to accept blame for the evil acts that my ancestors committed nor do I direct hatred toward the descendants of those who committed evil acts against my ancestors. Will all of this discussion rebuild a single mosque? Will it rebuild the Temple? Somehow I doubt that it will. A post in another group on the Bosnian war asked us all to love each other that love would conquer hate. Sadly I remember a TV interview with a young woman in Sarajevo (sp?) who was as I remember a former olympic calibre contestant in the rifle shoot. She was now trying to pick-off Serbian snipers. During the communist years she had married a Serb who was now fighting against her people. So it seems that hate will conquer love. Is there an odd chance that we might all forget past wrongs and try and see how we might all live together? It's a damn small planet which we have come very close to turning into a radioactive ball glowing softly in space. We seem to have been spared that prospect shall we now bathe it in each other's blood? Shalom Salam and Peace REB
2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Help Palestinian education HOW TO HELP PALESTINIAN EDUCATION (From 'Educational Network' No. 11 April 1993 publ. by Ramallah Friends Schools P.O.Box 66 Ramallah West Bank via Israel Tel. 972-2-956230  Fax. 972-2-956231) Many of our readers have written to us asking how individuals and organizations can help Palestinian education. We have compiled a list of suggestions to guide you. If you are interested in pursuing one or more of these suggested activities the Educational Network can aid you by /coordinating/ the initial contacts /following up/ and /providing any other support/ you may need. 1.  Link your teachers' union with a teachers' union here --- linkage should be based on a shared pedagogical enterprise. 2. Get your union to actively support the right of Palestinian teachers in the Occupied Territories to form unions: a. through the International Labor Organization (if your union is a member) b. contacting other international unions which have supported our right to form a union -- we can supply names and addresses. 3. Establish a SCHOLARSHIP FUND for one or more Palestinian students to study at a Palestinian university or school -- or establish a scholarship fund for a Palestinian student or teacher to study at a university abroad. 4. Reproduce and publish information about Palestinian education: a. for your union membership; b. for the outside community. The Educational Network can supply up-to-date information and statistics. 5. Send delegations of teachers to visit the Occupied Territories during periods when our schools are in session. The Network can arrange an itinerary make hotel and local travel arrangements and provide a guide for the visit. 6. Sponsor Palestinian teachers to visit your city for an educational tour: a. to see schools and speak with educators in order to learn about progressive pedagogical ideas and experiences; b. to speak about the conditions of Palestinian education. The Network will coordinate from Palestine. 7. Establish teacher-exchange programs for one year in which a Palestinian teacher from a private school teaches at a public or private school abroad while a teacher from that school spends a year in a Palestinian private school. 8. Send an experienced educator to the Occupied Territories to give workshops (all-day workshops or two- day workshops) on innovative teaching techniques. The Network will pay for the person's food lodging and travel while in Palestine and will serve as guide. 9. Set up a pen-pal program with a Palestinian school in either English or French. 10. Set up a sister-school program with a Palestinian school which would actively involve teachers as well as students at both schools -- a great tool for building international understanding and mutual sensitivity. 11. Keep the Educational Network informed about important educational conferences so that we can send a Palestinian teacher to attend. 12. Send to the Educational Network articles or other writings or books dealing with innovative approaches and ideas in the field of education so that we can then disseminate the information locally. 13. Support an educational development project in the Occupied Territories.
2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Rabin and his Palestinians kapos Rabin's plans for a Palestinian police (from The Other Front Alternative Information Center Jerusalem 5 May 1993) The decision to view the setting up of a local police force for (sic) the Palestinians as the central issue for deliberation at the peace talks to be resumed next week - even before subjects like elections in the territories and areas of juridiction in the framework of autonomy - is a sign of the Israeli government's serious attitude towards the peace process. The setting up of a police force is not part of the 'gesture package' but deals with the very heart and substance of the Palestinian struggle for national identity. As it turns out the main objective guiding the prime minister in the setting up of a Palestinian police force - and apparently also supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres - is to ensure the holding of democratic elections in the territories. Thus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial (Israeli daily Hadashot 23 April) and his position articulates the thinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this issue in the past two weeks. Over against them stand the settlers and rightwing parties who also interpret the decision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian police force as a significant step towards the instituting of real autonomy something which will restrict what can be done by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. With a variety of demonstrations including street theater on 'What will happen when there is a Palestinian police force' rightwing elements are attempting to frighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go back on his decision. Members of the Kach movement have even begun to organize a 'settler police force' in the Occupied Territories as counter-balance to the future Palestinian police force. However as Barzilai points out the main function of the new police force - as far as the Israeli government is concerned - has nothing to do with the settlers over whom they will apparently have no authority but will control political groups within the Palestinian population whom the government is interested in neutralizing. Writes Barzilai: ...According to ideas currently taking shape the setting up of a local police force in the territories will precede not only the stage of electsion but also the final stages of the preparing of the interim autonomy agreement. The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a local Palestinian police force is evidence that the government is serious about arriving at a settlement with the Palestinians... It's no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly worried about this new Israeli initiative. And it is inevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal Husseini and the rest of the delegation members from a variety of directions to refuse the gift which Rabin would like to give them. But at this stage it looks like the Palestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his plans. ---------------------------------------------------- Add'l comment by E.D.: Numerous Palestinians fear that Israel might succeed in co-opting some Palestinian circles by this idea. They fear that a Palestinian police force controlled in fact by Israel might act even more brutally than the IDF. The idea of using a surrogate police force is not new. It is used by Israel in Lebanon and was used by the Nazis to control Jewish ghetto-dwellers.
2,REFLECTIONS ON BOSNIA LORD OWEN AND THE SERBS In early February '93 Lord Owen made appearances in New York City on the Donahue and Charlie Rose shows. On a couple of occasions on those shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he made the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in dispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled and occupied by Serbs before WWII.  It was as if he were saying that since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and lost them during the Hitler years they should be allowed to reconquer them today. I was familiar with this view because my father a Yugoslav Jew who escaped to this country during the war was aided and found sympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years.  In recent months when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned my father would make the point that 850000 Serbs were killed by Nazi and pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha.  My father is so pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. My father also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis because my father said Anthony Lewis is always talking about the Muslims. Update--April 28 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around Sbernica shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and the killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton administration dithers its response.  In the days leading to the collapse of resistance at Sbernica Lord Owen changed his tune. Previously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds that it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forces began to march on Sbernica the threat to U.N. relief soldiers went unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention to stop Serbian aggression including the use of air strikes.  The current disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West and a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to halt the Serbs. Now that it's too late to save Muslim areas that Lord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state Lord Owen belatedly calls for strong action. CLINTON AND BOSNIA In the summer of 1992 George Kenney a senior State Department official the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk made news when he resigned from the State Department because of the Bush administration's refusal to take any action to halt Serbian aggression.  As Kenney saw it Bush's inaction was largely due to the president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by getting involved there. Apparently the same is true of the Clinton administration. Clinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did about the terrible ongoing tragedy but the practical effect has so far been the same. According to the New York Times (4/16/93) the Clinton administration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March report by its own experts which called for military action if necessary to protect safe havens for the Muslims. At one point Senate majority leader George Mitchell was so incensed that the report was kept from Congress that he called for an investigation. Instead of helping the desperate Bosnians Clinton has signalled again and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what they want in Bosnia--indeed Clinton and the West have been signalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish off the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other way.  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would NOT send in American military forces on the ground.  On this issue Clinton has made me wistful for Bush.  Bush and Baker could not have done worse and might have been pressured to do better well before this time.  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and the destruction might have been curtailed.. The Nation the left and the Bosnian QUANDARY Typical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core issue involved in Bosnia i.e. a clear aggressor destroying hundreds of thousands of lives is the editorial on the Bosnian quandary in The Nation (4/26/93).  In the end the editorial votes to do nothing even while noticing the ghastly atrocities of the Bosnian Serbs  and that the greater and lesser powers...dither and fuss [and] hang back. (Before anything else happens the Clinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the United States owes the U.N. the editorial concludes.) In its most striking passage the editorial writer warns that those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side of the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World War II.  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the Bosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients including the Chileans the South Africans the Greek fascists and others. (In a subsequent column for The Nation Christopher Hitchens correctly called this editorial contemptible.) *** William Pfaff a European based journalist who writes for the The New Yorker and the Los Angeles Times is among a group of liberal columnists like Anthony Lewis and Leslie Gelb who have clearly and consistently called for strong Western and American intervention to stop the Serbs.  Pfaff's most recent column (Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled International Cowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy. He clarifies the international failure which has led to present situation in one sentence. Having refused to intervene to sanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent Croatia in June 1991 or to block or penalize the military aggression by Serbia that immediately followed and the atrocious ethnic cleansing which followed that the United Nations now contemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which two years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since experienced.  He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged call for a more daunting and open-ended military assignment than a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have been a year ago. Aryeh Neier on the Serbs In his Watching Rights column in the The Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the motivation of the aggressors--the preferred term for the Serbian forces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than a year.  He explains that there is no  military purpose that is served by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Above all few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt.  They are not city people. It is this I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of Bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at any price--that explains the conduct of the siege of Sarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban pluralist and cosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation. Historically most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been rural while Muslims who were the civil servants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule made up a disproportionate share of the urban population....The destruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility against this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....The demagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war exploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred for all that is cosmopolitan. The light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is at stake.  The Serbs represent the know-nothing anti-secularist fundamentalist fascist forces who are attacking the urban cosmopolitan secular multi-cultural idea.  They are attacking the rest of us just as Hitler did. One irony is that at the beginning of the crisis over Bosnia it was for awhile maintained by the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a threat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state. Neier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat to secularism multi-culturalism diversity and democracy.  It's the Serbs who are attacking the democratic notion the democratic idea. Anthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does respect for Clinton's presidency depend...on his acting effectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because to do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values we and our allies profess.  (Times 4/26/93) But it's not merely a betrayal of our values.  It's because the Serbs are attacking us by proxy just as Hitler was. One argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a different form is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for Europe.  We hear it as the Bosnians are Europe's Palestinians; that is to say just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been the key to instability in the Middle East just so will the hundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities result in turmoil in Europe for decades to come. One of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though the Atlantic Ocean divides us the Americas are ultimately tied to the destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized the U.S. will inevitably be affected and drawn into its problems.  As in a whirlpool  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom. And as past history and Pfaff have shown it's much better if we do so decisively quickly and on our terms. Sincerely Ronald Bleier

(London Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316. In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city of Van whose 33789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan on April 28 1915 Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days. Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves. With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies. ...Meanwhile Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans with the president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response: 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the glorious Russian Army with their blood to serve the victory of Russian arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the Bosporus. Let with Your will great Majesty the peoples remaining under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new free life under the protection of Russia.'[155] Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies. Preparations were made to strike the Ottomans from the rear and the czar returned to St. Petersburg confident that the day finally had come for him to reach Istanbul.

An Armenian state was organized at Van under Russian protection and it appeared that with the Muslim natives dead or driven away it might be able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient Armenian civilization. An Armenian legion was organized 'to expel the Turks from the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet.'[162] Thousands of Armenians from Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new Armenian state...By mid-July there were as many as 250000 Armenians crowded into the Van area which before the crisis had housed and fed no more than 50000 people Muslim and non-Muslim alike.[163] [162] Hovannisian Road to Independence p. 56; FOP 2488 nos. 127223 and 58350.

I went through this just a few weeks ago; here it comes again. The entire Turkish population of Armenia (which Armenians called Tartars) constituted at least about 40% of the total population of Armenia was deliberately exterminated. (For the population statistics please look to the book of Richard Hovannessian Armenia on the Road to Independence.) I listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime by the writings of one Armenian one American and one British. They are: Men Are Like That by Leonard R. Hartill; Adventures in the Near East by A. Rawlinson; World Alive A Personal Story by Robert Dunn. Also I personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings of two Armenians and also one American. The official British report about this massacre mentioned in one of these documents (Lord Curzon-Aharonin interview) is the report of the British High Commissioner to Caucasia Sir Oliver Wardrop. An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in 1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound.

I will dissect article-by-article paragraph-by-paragraph line-by-line lie-by-lie revision-by-revision written by those on this net who plan to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide.

You and those like you will not get away with the genocide's cover-up. During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920 the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1000 year homeland. The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4700000 of whom 940000 (20 percent) were Armenian 1200000 (25 percent) Georgian and 2220000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group 1140000 were Tatars. Paradoxically barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd the administrative center of the province had only 44000 Armenians as compared to 68000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897 however the Armenians had established a scant majority 53 percent in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent or 670000 of the 1120000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic a solid block of 370000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.

During the course of evening I asked Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied Yes I assisted in its sack and destruction and witnessed the slaying of those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins. p. 202 (first and second paragraphs).

The Tartars were for the most part poor. Some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley from plain to mountain and from mountain to plain following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. Even the village Tartars are a primitive people only semicivilized. I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars and while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country regarded and treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility. p. 20 (second paragraph). Our men armed themselves gathered together and advanced on the Tartar section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear. Our men hammered on the doors but got no response; whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night I cowered at home in terror unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished. p. 109 (second paragraph). As things were the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means. The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law. When they became a legally instituted recognized governing body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days. The outstanding feature of their rule now that they were in power was as in the old days trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts. p. 203 (first paragraph). A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body and raising it to his lips licked it clean of blood exclaiming in Russian 'Slodkey! Slodkey!' (Sweet.) p. 203 (second paragraph). One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls mere children. The girls were crouched on the ground crying softly with suppressed sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the dead. p. 204 (first paragraph). I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying I entered the yard of a house which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child a girl about a year old. p. 118. Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow the cart jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen encouraging them with shrill Tartar cries and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the carts the women veiled as is the Tartar way held children in their arms. Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot. Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts screamed ran and sought vainly for safety. This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by barracks hearing the firing and the turmoil hurried to the scene.... That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed. p. 192. Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the Turks. p. 193. Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars Kurds and Turks. Their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country. p. 195. The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity: Tartars Kurds and Russians. p. 218. (First and second paragraphs) Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in the slaughtering of prisoners the looting and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace actions expected and accepted as a matter of course. I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground in numbers like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle fired with ardor and courage with weapons in their hands and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself. p. 133 (first paragraph) In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the brutality displayed but could not make any effective protest. Some mercifully were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut and then after crowding the hut with Turks set fire to the straw. p. 19 (first paragraph) The Tartar section of the town no longer existed except as a pile of ruins. It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. The same fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi. p. 22 (second paragraph) Many of our men had served in the Russian Army and were trained soldiers. We Armenians were rich and possessed arms. Tartars had never received military training. They were poor and possessed few arms beyond

How can you  have the gall to even open your mouths about >Karabakh until Turkish troops are  completely out of the independent >island of Cyprus. No wonder you 'wieneramus' are in such a mess. Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek army Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. And the next is 'Karabag'. The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece someday whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios. The release of Nikos Sampson a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus committed murder to achieve this goal and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct. THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM 2 Irfan Bey Street Kumsal Area Nicosia Cyprus It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks on 20th December 1963 Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom where they had tried to  hide by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum. AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS The date  is the 24th of  December 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks which  started three days ago has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed... The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism. Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum an  eye witness who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event. On the night of the 24th  of December 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor was standing in the bath with her three children Murat Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying in  Greek You want Taksim eh!  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks who broke  into the bathroom emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan then I fainted. When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet where  in  the doorway  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered. In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying Help help. Is  there no one to save us?  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed. An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded. We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally as we could  walk Mrs. Novber and I went  out into the street hoping to  find help and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik. There we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter. After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus Greeks arrested me at the Airport. All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me. ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days. We  were the  first  Western  reporters there  and  we saw  some terrible sights. In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2 Irfan Bey Sokagi we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner. In the  bathroom looking  like a group  of waxworks  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother. In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head. This we  were told was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence. Today was five days later and still they lay there.

If somebody wishes to counter the reality she described fine. [PTS] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [PTS] [PTS] [PTS]       The Conflict Over Nagorno-Karabakh: An Azeri Perspective [PTS]       -------------------------------------------------------- [PTS]                            By Alec Rasizade [PTS] [PTS] [AR] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno (Upper) Karabakh [AR] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western [AR] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established [AR] Armenian-American community.  Azeri views on this dispute have [AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me [AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the [AR] origins of the conflict. During the past two years if one reads all the commentaries on the subject a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri. The following should be interesting. [AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and [AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually [AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian [AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988 [AR] when 165000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move [AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait [AR]in February 1988 and two years later in Baku in January 1990. This not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers I will quote from an independent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_ 29 September 1991 page 28 we read: By mid-november many incidents took place in several places in Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party for power. ... After ten days the authorities came in with tanks to reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan the last Armenian villages were deported. In Ganja Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40000 Armenian inhabitants fled the city... Between 22 November and 8 December 1988 refugees from Ganja arrived in Armenia while all 167000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away. In this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian pogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988! [AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that [AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule [AR] in the Transcaucasus according to the Roman principle of divide and [AR] rule.  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year [AR] history of the conflict. It is interesting that the Azeris killed burnt raped the Armenians but the perpetrators blame Russians and Armenians themselves on other occasions. [AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in [AR] Zheleznovodsk Moscow Tehran Rome Geneva and Alma-Ata) an [AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in [AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict as well as the Georgian [AR] turmoil are imperialist forces in Russia and probably in Iran. Incorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an agreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno- Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict. [AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100000 new Azeri [AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and [AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500000 Azeri refugees throng the [AR] city of Baku and environs providing more problems for the newly [AR] elected Popular Front government which is opposed by the rigidly [AR] nationalistic National Independence Party. It's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways keep their Armenian culture these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The Azeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and play dead. [AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country [AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the [AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees as Kurdish [AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped how can the Azeri government [AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands homes and [AR] possessions? The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they attempted to deprive Armenians of lands homes and possessions. [AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West. [AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian [AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent and therefore irreversible [AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus. True and you Dr. Alec Rasizade should practice what you preach! [AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea. [AR] Meanwhile continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western [AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security [AR] alliances.  These include on the Armenian side the Moscow-led [AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact signed [AR] May 15 1992.  On the Azeri side should Turkey get involved as the [AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct. [AR] 13 1921 these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces. Western interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of Europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia! Dr. Rasizade international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would have us believe. [AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an [AR]Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.  The truth is that the Armenians [AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century. Incorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish claim. Armenians today refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as Artsakh which comes from the Urartian term Urtekhe-Urtekhini. NO Azeris yet! Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as Orkhistena. NO Azeris yet! In the first half of the 6th century B.C. Artsakh as part of Ervandid Armenia of Media. NO Azeris yet! From the end of the 4th century B.C. Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom of Ervan. NO Azeris yet! Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena or Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet! After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 A.D. until 428 Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet! End of the 5th century Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the Aranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet! By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet! Emperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen To Armenia. Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet! In the decree of Paul I (1797) the number of Armenian families in this area was stated as 11000. It was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central Asia Asia Minor and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence in the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh! In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some Muslims in Karabakh! In 1914 the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224 188 priests 206768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian percentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh -- assuming no Kurds! Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1 1920: The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan having been informed of the proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic sends its greetings to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh Zangezur and Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis Republic. Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet Armenia and Azerbaidzan! Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan N. Narimanov People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Guseinov [AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their [AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh after it came under Russian [AR] rule. No incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule in the Caucasus including Karabakh! [AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew [AR] in Russian and German settlers who were welcomed by Azeris.  How [AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in [AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland and [AR] demanded separation from California? Non-sequitur. [AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement [AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct. Armenian historians don't say this! [AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the [AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and [AR] nothing in common with Armenians. Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith and their utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy makes such an argument totally invalid! [AR] Azeris would have a better claim to [AR] be successors of Albania since Azeris have for centuries inhabited [AR] dominated and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation. Wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo- political advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity Azeris claim to be Turks Persians and all the while are Azerizing their minorities such as the Lezgians Kurds Tat Talish and a host of other nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan. [AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the [AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975 and the [AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990 confirming their mutual [AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This [AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the [AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory [AR] nations not just by Turkey. Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of Armenians. [AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N. the [AR] CSCE the Commonwealth NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the [AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor according to the [AR] U.N. definition of 1974. Fine so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian enclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory is the home of Armenians the UN would by definition support the local population! [AR] When that is accomplished the international community can and should [AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as [AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the [AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can [AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh and prevent the Armenian-Azeri [AR] conflict from growing and spreading. Azerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their own future the is issue not viewing isolating events out of context are actions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as an act of Allied aggression!

There have been no amendments to the Iranian Transactions Regulations (ITRs) 31 CFR Part 560 or to the Iranian Assets Control Regulations (IACRs) 31 CFR Part 535 since the last report. 2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (FAC) of the Department of the Treasury continues to process applications for import licenses under the ITRs.  However as previously reported recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of applications received relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods. During the reporting period the Customs Service has continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin merchandise primarily carpets for violation of the import prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi- gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review. 3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the Tribunal) established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers Accords continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims before it.  Since the last report the Tribunal has rendered 12 awards for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total 367 have been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were awards on agreed terms authorizing and approving payment of settlements negotiated by the parties and 145 were decisions adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards 3 approved the withdrawal of cases and 56 were in favor of Iranian claimants.  As of March 31 1993 awards to successful American claimants from the Security Account held by the NV Settlement Bank stood at $2340072357.77. As of March 31 1993 the Security Account has fallen below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has periodically replenished the account as required by the Algiers Accords by transferring funds from the separate account held by the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the United States pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by- case basis by FAC.  Iran has not however replenished the account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8 1992. The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest Account to the Security Account is $874472986.47.  As of March 31 1993 the total amount in the Security Account was $216244986.03 and the total amount in the Interest Account was $8638133.15. 4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250000.00 or more. Since the last report nine large claims have been decided. More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been disposed of through adjudication settlement or voluntary withdrawal leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger claims the resolution of which has been slowed by their complexity are finally being resolved sometimes with sizable awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example two claimants were awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October 1992. 5.  As anticipated by the May 13 1990 agreement settling the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250000.00 the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (FCSC) has continued its review of 3112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in 1201 claims for total awards of more than $22 million.  The FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining claims in early 1994. 6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies the Department of State continues to present United States Government claims against Iran as well as responses by the United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran. In November 1992 the United States filed 25 volumes of supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3) Iran's claim against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign Military Sales Program.  In February of this year the United States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation violated the Algiers Accords. 7.  As reported in November Jose Maria Ruda President of the Tribunal tendered his resignation on October 2 1992.  No successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda's resignation will take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up his duties. 8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve important diplomatic financial and legal interests of the United States and its nationals.  Iran's policy behavior presents challenges to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords. Similarly the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613 continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter- national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the Congress on significant developments. WILLIAM J.

Sarkis Atamian explains in his book called 'The Armenian Community New York 1955 Philosophical Library' that according to historians original fatherland of the Armenians was in Thessaly Greece. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of Urartus massacred and exterminated its population and presented to the world all those left from the Urartus as the Armenian civilization. All reliable western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women children and elderly people of Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the Muslim people between 1914-1920. It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II and that even today criminal members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate racism hatred violence and terrorism among peoples. >Please tell me how on earth Armenians fully participated in the genocide >of Jews during WWII are you on some heavy drugs? Who says 'Arromdians' are no damn good? During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal the Armenian publication in Germany Hairenik carried statements as follows:[1] Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease and when it becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical operation the flow of blood is a natural thing. Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11 1983 published in the San Francisco Chronicle as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian. We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities against our people (Jews). Members of our family witnessed the murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum Turkey by Armenian neighbors bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors. Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war on his premise to grant themselves government if in return the Armenians would help exterminate Jews. Armenians were also hearty proponents of the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Signed Elihu Ben Levi Vacaville California. [1] James G.

During the years of World War I the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland which is the crux of Turkish political demands fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways: 1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility. 2. x-Soviet Armenia employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide. 3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests. 4. Using all its human financial and governmental resources x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism bribery and other subversive methods non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause be they political governmental and humanitarian. Using all the aforementioned methods the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue. Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations in the last decades thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide. With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand: 1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship recognize the Turkish Genocide; 2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people; 3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide; 4. that all world governments and especially the United States officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure; 5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally x-Soviet Armenia and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands; 6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.

Crown Publishers Inc. New York (1952). (Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people) p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph). 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.' 'No dammit! My stomach isn't-' 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.' We were under those trees by the mosque in an open space.... 'I don't believe you I said but followed to a nail-studded door. The man pushed it ajar then spurred away leaving me to check on the corpse. I thought I should this charge was so constant so gritted my teeth and went inside. The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes and was dark at first for its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot. All looked bare and empty but in an inner room flies buzzed. As the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face up naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone so I'd no proof which he was and quickly went out gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals. p. 363 (first paragraph). 'How many people lived there?' 'Oh about eight hundred.' He yawned. 'Did you see any Turk officers?' 'No sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.' The lieutenant dozed off then I but in the small hours a voice woke me - Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into laughter quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense of guilt I thought or hoped. For somehow despite my boast of irreligion Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would have been. From daybreak on Armenian villagers poured in from miles around..... The women plundered happily chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels the last scrap of food or cloth and staggered away packing pots saddlebags looms even spinning-wheels. 'Thank you for a lot Dro' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must leave.'...We shook hands the captain said 'A bientot mon camarade.' And for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all doubtless in a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.' p. 354. At morning tea Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics they spoke Russian but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on Moslem villages. p. 358. It will be three hours to take Dro told me. We'd close in on three sides. The men on foot will not shoot but use only the bayonets Merrimanov said jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. That is for morale Dro put in. We must keep the Moslems in terror. Soldiers or civilians? I asked. There is no difference said Dro. All are armed in uniform or not. But the women and children? Will fly with the others as best they may. p. 360. The ridges circled a wide expanse its floors still. Hundreds of feet down the fog held solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that' said Dro pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.' Then 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff the horde - nose to tail bellies taking the spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war even though I heard our Utica brass roar. As I watched from the height it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed dogs barked invisible while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted at first heard faintly. The came a shrill wailing. Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in clump of trees thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks while one twisted a bronze shell-nose loaded and yanked breech-cord firing again and again. Shots wasted I thought when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and tough through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly through alders on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals several calves and a lamb. p. 361 (fourth paragraph). Corpses came next the first a pretty child with straight black hair large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet had gone through her back I judged for blood around was scant. Between the breasts one clot too small for a bullet wound crusted her homespun dress. The next was a boy of ten or less in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the pewter bowl he'd carried now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed just below his neck into the spine. There were grownups too I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead. p. 358. ...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands Turkish troop shifts hidden arms spies - Christian Red or Tartar - coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would break loose if Versailles were to put as threatened the six 'Armenian' vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan... An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. That's bloodshed - just Smyrna over again on a bigger scale.

When the Russian armies invaded Turkey after the Sarikamish disaster of 1914 their columns were preceded by battalions of irregular Armenian volunteers both from the Caucasus and from Turkey. One of these was commanded by a certain Andranik a blood-thirsty adventurer. These Armenian volunteers committed all kinds of excesses more than six hundred thousand Kurds being killed between 1915 and 1916 in the eastern vilayets of Turkey.

Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells they were locked in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to. Including women and children such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled everything that the people had has been taken away from them and we found them in a destitute situation. At the present time the people are subsisting on some food they obtained impelled by starvation from Russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area.

(Memoirs of a British officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people) p. 184 (second paragraph) I had received further very definite information of horrors that had been committed by the Armenian soldiery in Kars Plain and as I had been able to judge of their want of discipline by their treatment of my own detached parties I had wired to Tiflis from Zivin that 'in the interests of humanity the Armenians should not be left in independent command of the Moslem population as their troops being without discipline and not under effective control atrocities were constantly being committed for which we should with justice eventually be held to be morally responsible'. p. 177 (third paragraph) Armenian troops who having pillaged and destroyed all the Moslem villages in the plain.... Caravans of refugees were in the meanwhile constantly arriving from the plain from which the whole Moslem population was fleeing with as much of their personal property as they could transport seeking to obtain security and protection... p. 178 (first paragraph) In those Moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched for arms by the Armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of such search and not only had many Moslems been killed but horrible tortures had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as to where valuables had been hidden of which the Armenians were aware of the existence although they had been unable to find them. p. 181 (first paragraph) the Armenians from the plain were attacking the Kurdish line with artillery with probably a large force in support. p. 175 (first paragraph) The arrival of this British brigade was followed by the announcement that Kars Province had been allotted by the Supreme Council of the Allies to the Armenians and that announcement having been made the British troops were then completely withdrawn and Armenian occupation commenced. Hence all the trouble; for the Armenians at once commenced the wholesale robbery and persecution of the Muslem population on the pretext that it was necessary forcibly to deprive them of their arms. In the portion of the province which lies in the plains they were able to carry out their purpose and the manner in which this was done will be referred to in due course.

The obsession with discussions of past (or present) events seems to be largely centered on trying to prove that they are worse than us. As we see over and over that leads nowhere except to make ourselves feel superior. It's as if we've become addicted to periodic injections of self-affirmation that draw their power from denigration of the other and romanticization of ourselves. The hope is that we will begin sometime to apply these discussions in some way towards consideration of how to defuse the situation advancement of negotiations and the search for common ground between the parties involved. Of course for this to happen we can't believe that the best path to *making ourselves feel better* is at the expense of others.

ED> ED> Elias The above claim that you do not hate anybody may not be quite true.  The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in this group.  Your complete lack of objectivity toward Israel and Jewish identity in general reveal biases that indicate a great steaming heap of hatred! You certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for objectivity. You repeatedly post items or quotes removed from their original context so that they can be used to further an agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of Israel. You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image of several Israeli leaders.  I can't say if you actually HATE these leaders but the lies and misrepresentations of them do suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them. So while you claim that you do not hate anybody there is an ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is false.  It is obvious that you hate Israel and it is evident that you hate the Jewish people. And if you are Jewish you are a self-hating Jew.  There can be no doubt of this.  Although you will call upon your Jewish background in an effort to claim the high moral ground there is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade away completely as a people.  Your advocacy of intermarriage for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that you hate the Jewish people. And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your own Jewishness on all Jews you've clearly demonstrated to me that you hate yourself. *       *       *       * Who is a Jew?

2,Providing safety and security for one's own people is the most fundamental responsibility of any political entity. For the Palestinian leadership to refuse to accept this responsibility i.e. take the responsibility to protect their people from radical Palestinian elements who are opposed to the peace process is reprehensible. To argue that a Palestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful political groups only reinforces the reality that the Palestinian leadership so far can not exercise control over radical Palestinian elements nor effectively deal with the killing of Palestinians by Palestinians. This is a problem that can only be solved by the Palestinian people.

All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq not to Liberate Kuwait The people who were killed by the invasion are more (many many more) than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis in their smaller invasion. I lived in the west and I have seen how your media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that led to the invasion as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to be surprised not to know). It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid. What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis over 200000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen if no western intervention happened and the second case was a direct or indirect result of western envolvement. Human rights in Kuwait? what about human rights in Iraq? why the west gave Saddam a green light to slaughter his own people? I will give my reason: because the rich Kuwaitis do not mind to be your salves so they deserve some democracy but Iraqis might not so they don't.

Not necessarily the best solution my view of an Islamic state (and that of Turabi that your media made you hate) includes all the benefits of a secular state minus the injustices. Did you ever read a book by Rashid Al-Ghannoushi (Tunisia) Hassan Turabi (Sudan)? You only know about them from your Self-censured self-controlled media. If they make this kind of campaign against such a moderate thinker as Turabi is and keep quite about such an extremist Muslim scholar as Bin Bez of Saudi Arabia is it just does not encourage any moderation in our ARab world. >You make it sound like these guys are angels Ilyess.  (In your >clarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???) No it was not that it was just some irrelevent stuff that I took out to go around the copyright (;-)) I ceased to take the Newyork times seriously. In issues concerning Islam it has become one of the biggest enemies (although less than the other NewYork daily since Mortimer took it over). It lies selects facts that fits its agenda and even prints racist and open anti-Muslim editorials. What they claimed in that articles is a bunch of lies because while the selected facts are true about some of those persons the other members are actually defence lawyers and University science professors who wanted to fight corruption uncover atrocities against opposition activists and Shia minority and generally increase awareness about the rights of all citizens. The only thing that is common between those people is their concern for the deterioration of human rights since the Saudi clan took a green light from AMerica (after the gulf) to do whatever is necessary to stay in power. Do you know that ALL OF THE SAUDI ULEMA have been taught the same things? the ones in the official Iftaa are as conservative as the ones that are opposing it. SOme of the members of the human rights committe are MORE PRO-WOMEN and wanted to defend them and that is precisely one reason that Bin Bez's Fatwah  implied for the Illegality  of this committee and  for his claim that it represents Outside interests There is a human rights issue in Saudi ARabia and YOU and NY times chose to ignore the main issue and select some of the members of that committee and actually defend the actions done against them (including banning them from their Jobs. What a hypocricy. I am not surprised really THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. The official Ulema are the most extremist anti-women meat-heads in Saudi Arabia the west continues on its campaign to discredit itself in the Muslim community by supporting them. Well after Bosnia I guess it has ZERO credibility to begin with so what the heck. Idha Lam tastahi Faf'aal Ma shi'it (If you feel no shame then do whatever you want Hadith). (actually a better translation of the meaning would be: If you do not feel ashamed (from God) you will do whatever you want)

You are somewhat close to truth. But you shouldn't forget that nationality is a recent invention of the western europe. In the days of the Ottoman empire the religion was the main point of difference between social classes. The Ottomans didn't recognize Turks Arabs Greeks Serbs... Just christians muslims jews... So for all the interested parties in the Ottoman society the bosnian muslims were Turks. After all there aren't many real (ethnic) Turks living even in Turkey today.

I agree with you. But I also feel that when a culture feels it is confronted by another group that wishes to see that culture disassembled the first culture has little choice but to *try* to secure its survival as well as maintain its moral center. Since the culture is not about to turn away from *either* the matter of its survival or the valuing of its moral principles it has the virtually impossible job of balancing. To discuss Israel's faults and crimes without *any* recognition of this circumstance and *reality* it faces is a conscious decision based on the discussant's political biases NOT on an honest and empathetically open understanding of the situation. The same applies to those who attempt to paint the Palestinian movement as all bad and dispense with considerations of the *reality* facing them. > >>That certainly describes Elias >>since he has no intention of recognizing that alongside the Palestinian >>experience and perspective there exists also that of Israelis. > >He might not want to recognize that.

You beg the question by centering on the symptoms while the issue of self-hating addresses the motivations. I certainly feel that anyone who expends so much effort inflating distorting and robbing human context from aspects of his/her own culture is reflecting a degree of dislike for it.

As you well know this process of *blaming the other* for the morally questionable actions one side is forced (by the other of course) to take is thoroughly practiced by **both sides**.

However in my response to the initial discussion above between Davidsson and those opposing his presentations I saw Davidsson carefully putting academic frills around a blatantly one-sided series of I-hate/dislike- them yesIdoyesIdoyesIdo. I did *not* find the approach of those opposing Davidsson to be centered *at all* on a denigration and denial of the other side. I certainly do wonder if the degree to which Davidsson's views on the Middle East have distorted is connected to his dislike and rejection of his jewish lineage. Having said this however I agree with you that this constant accusing others of being self-hating jews seems pointless. It is not worse a label than is why you're on their side except to perhaps imply a certain degree of overly enthusiastic biasedness.

However This is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI many Bosnian Muslims were killed and their land taken over by Serbs and the motive was plunder not some fictitious supression of rebellion.  Even earlier one can point to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of Muslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic political adviser to the Serbian monarchic regime says in his memorandum The Expulsion of the Arnauts which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic on March 7 1937 in Belgrade: The Mode of Removal ------------------- [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed through state terror and private initiative i.e. Chetnik plunder: ] Private initiative too can assist greatly in this direction.  We should distribute weapons to our colonists as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...] ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and if need be ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally local riots can be incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the Chetniks rather than the army. There remains one more means WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL EFFECT AFTER 1878 that is by secretly burning down Albanian villages and city quarters. (Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually all Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism against Muslims aided by Chetnik private initiative has continued in WWII and today.  For example Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book Od tradicije do identiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana (Sarajevo: Svjetlost 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca in WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot explaining their action as follows: Inasmuch as you were a Serb you sullied the Serb name because you are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us we shall not torture you. so the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year Serbs have repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction of mosques including priceless historical monuments completes the eradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs. >>I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda >>in fact for the past century or two Croats and Muslims have seen >>themselves as having a lot in common and they generally had friendly >>relations.

The last major battles between Austro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the end of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism came into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic who saw Bosnian Muslims as the best Croats so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations to Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian nationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As for your other theories you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim alliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.

In international relations 101 you'll learn that unless weak unite to counterbalance the strong player soon they are taken over and that's the end of them.  Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats and Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are unstable.  I'm working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and Muslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed. You are wrong if you think only image is at stake here.  Croatia has a deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims and vice versa. I think Tudjman understands this although he does not have much choice at this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier before any open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will survive it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse off.  However their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not see it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left? If not then all bets are off. Mr. Stojanovic is clearly very very happy about this.  I'm deeply hurt. This is not about some image but about survival of a concept of a partnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats and Muslims. Sigh... Josip

Odishe Liyetze on the Turkish front he wrote On the nights 11-12 March 1918 alone Armenian butchers bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits most likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish Muslims in groups of 80. My adjutant counted and unearthed 200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization. On March 12 1918 Lieut-colonel Griyaznof wrote (from an official Russian account of the Turkish genocide) Roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos dismembered joints and carved out organs of Muslim peasants... alas! mainly of women and children.

(Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov) The things I have heard and seen during the two months until the liberation of Erzurum by the Turks have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious degenerate characteristic of the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum no Armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs. While the Commander of the First Army Corps General Kaltiyin remained in power troops including Armenian enlisted men were not sent to the area. When the security measures were lifted the Armenians began to attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war. One day while passing through the streets on horseback a group of soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud and dirt... It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night patrol did not return and no one knew what had happened to them. The Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also. Finally the Court Martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder and rape which had decreased began to occur more frequently. Sometime in January and February a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir Efendi from Erzurum was killed one night at his home. The Commander in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days. The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned. ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief Odishelidge. They were as follows: The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers and the act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades... More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later the murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses: 'Seventy dead bodies well this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten more Turks would be cut into pieces thrown into the hole and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil. The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty Turks and cut their heads off one by one. Following the Erzincan massacre the Armenians began to withdraw towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road and destroyed the entire population together with the villages. During the transportation of the cannons ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area certain people were hired among the Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers were passing through Erzurum the Armenians took advantage of the time when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying Kurds they attempted to help them. However the Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened and thus prevented them from acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing. Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However since the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony the Armenian failed in his attempt. Having seen this the Armenian ripped open the abdomen of the Kurd disembowelled him and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot. Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov who passed through the village of Ilica three weeks after the massacre told us the following: There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces on the roads. Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads cursed and spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter square dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder. A few educated Armenian girls who worked as telephone operators for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told the girls that the Armenians including women were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous. An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on February 20: The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head. The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts. The others the Armenians claimed were released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the Armenian officers Karagodaviev. Today some Turks were murdered on the streets. On February 12 some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for murdering an innocent Turk. When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would be hanged for his crime the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum the Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17 I heard that the entire population of Tepekoy village situated within the artillery area had been totally annihilated. On the same day when Antranik entered Erzurum I reported the massacre to him and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act. However no result was achieved. In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred there was a natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February the Armenians deceived the Russians perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the Turkish soldiers. Later it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons for one night and ran away. The leading Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre. However the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre just as in all the others. The lower classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders. No for there were people who opposed the Armenians for such actions since they understood that it would yield no result. However such people were only a minority. Furthermore such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly. Some on the other hand preferred to remain silent. There were certain others who when accused by the Russians of infamy would say the following: 'You are Russians. You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the Turkish soldiers. The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can be undone.

Just put this line into your >global kill file: Well does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920 the Armenian Government ordered incited assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race religion and national origin? Between 1914 and 1920 2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia. They were persecuted banished and slaughtered while much of Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide as acting with a 'specific intent to destroy in whole or in substantial part a national ethnic racial or religious group.' History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy as a massacre of the Kurds Turks and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established beyond any doubt that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian territories. The Muslims of Van Bitlis Mus Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon Tercan Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government. The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro Antranik Armen Garo Hamarosp Daro Pastirmadjian Keri Karakin Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

The criminal acts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government come directly under the scope of the Convention on Genocide adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 8 1948 containing the following provisions: The Contracting Parties having considered the declaration made by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution 95 (1) dated December 11 1946 that genocide is a crime under international law contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world; Recognizing that in all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity; and Being convinced that in order to liberate mankind from such odious scourge international cooperation is required; Members agree as hereinafter provided: Article 1. The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide whether committed in time of peace or in time of war is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish. Article 2. In the present Convention genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group as such: A) Killing member of the group; B) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; C) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; D) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; E) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group; Article 3. The following acts shall be punishable: a) Genocide b) Conspiracy to commit genocide c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide d) Attempt to commit genocide. Article 4. Persons committing genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Article 3 shall be punished whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers public officials or private individuals. Had the Convention on Genocide existed before the Armenian massacres of the Turks and Kurds it would probably have been difficult for the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its responsibles to start murdering of civilian defenseless faithful Ottoman citizens children and women (GENOCIDE AND ATTEMPT TO GENOCIDE) to make plans to exterminate as they have done also to Urartus and Jews faithful Ottoman citizens (CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT GENOCIDE) to incite Armenians to armed revolt against the legal authority and to commit Genocide (DIRECT AND PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO COMMIT GENOCIDE).

Let's take Sarkis Atamian's (an Armenian Dashnak sociolog) book The Armenian Community pages 97 and 105. Atamian quotes: ... the immediate question concerned itself with the organization and tactics of revolution. The liberation of Armenia the immediate aim of the Party was to be attained by: 1. Oral and written propaganda. 2. Terrorism - both as punishment against the enemy and as a measure of self defense. 3. The creation of an avant-garde of revolutionary groups to be equipped and prepared for action when other nations were prepared for a general uprising. 4. The organization of larger committees to be in constant contact with each other and subject to a central body. 5. Organization of units of guerilla fighters. Now on page 105 Atamian's book quotes of Armenian constitution: ... If the means was revolution how was the revolution to be attained? By: 1. Propaganda 2. Preparation of combat units and their indoctrination 3. Encouragement of the revolutionary morale of the people 4. The arming of the people 5. Organization of revolutionary committees 6. Espionage throughout the country and the exchange of information with the official bodies and journals 7. Organization of financial zones for public collection 8. 'Fighting and using' the weapon of the terror on corrupt government officers spies traitors grafters and all sorts of oppressors 9. Defense of the people against attacks from the brigandry 10. Building of roads for the transport of arms 11. Wrecking and looting of governmental institutions. Many of the recent Armenian terrorist acts against the Turkish people were committed by the brainwashed members of the Tzeghagron namely race-worshipers of the Dashnag Youth Organization. Ironically again Tzeghagron was set up by an undisputed Armenian Nazi Karekin Nejdeh in 1941 (see Atamian loc cit page 389).

Pardon me? Your ignorance cramps my conversation. Although the administrative mechanism was a strictly centralized one the Ottoman Empire 'was a classical example of a pluralist social order.' The 'millet system' was the mechanism which shaped the social order of the multi-national Ottoman Empire and stood behind its continuity. As a matter of fact because Islamic principles were in force in the Ottoman Empire it was natural to use religious criteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted the Empire. The 'millet' system began to be based on ethnicity in the 19th century under the influence of nationalism. Sousa writes of the existence of thirteen communities in the Ottoman Empire in addition to the Muslim 'millet' in 1914. These were: (1) Greeks attached to the Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul; (2) Catholics or Latins who were remnants of Genoese and Venetian merchants; (3) Gregorian Armenians attached to a Patriarchate in Istanbul; (4) Catholic Armenians; (5) Syrian Catholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (6) Chaldean Catholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mosul; (7) Syrian Jacobites attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (8) Protestants; (9) Melchites attached to a Patriarchate in Damascus; (10) Hebrews of two rites; (11) Bulgarian Catholics attached to the Bulgarian Exarch; (12) Maronites; and (13) Nestorians.[1] Scholars who studied the pluralistic social structure outlined briefly above concluded that the social order of the Ottoman Empire fit the framework of the 'Mosaics Theory.'[2] [1] N.

Is that how the mind of a compulsive liar works? The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in x-Soviet Armenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the plots the perpetrators and the underdogs. The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre: 69 year old Hatin Nine telling: -''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.'' 72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu: - ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours. While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are Turks you must die.'' 28 year old Gulsum Huseyin: - ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes.'' Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region? The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures of people who were bayonetted whose eyes were gouged ears cut off. Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these lies. They are saying exaggeration. That means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach... The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word. Some of the western press' led by some French Newspapers ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre. Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.'' The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe) and rules all designed to fight against human rights violations. International reactions must be made with international cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized. Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals journalists writers TV stations of certain western countries such as France who are fast to claim leadership of human rights? Where are you?

Now you are using meanings completely different from indeed in some cases diametrically different from those given in the dictionary.

2,I don't mean to sound disrespectful but since the majority of the contributors (and may be even readers) of this newsgroup seem to be muslims christians and jews my question could be of some interest to any of them. It's my impression that both Islam and Christianity pay great respect to an obscure 1st century jewish lad from Judea/Galilee. Why they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery to me (personally I prefer Woody Allen - his stories are much juicier) - but perhaps it's an accident of history. Anyway it seems that they may be talking about two different jews. According to the New Testament his father's name was Joseph while in Qur'an he appears as Zachariah. Who's right and why the name difference? I'm really curious. David.
2,Ilyess sez: >So how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolled >back the Iraqi invasion were you in charge of Saudi Arabia??? All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq not to Liberate Kuwait The people who were killed by the invasion are more (many many more) than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis in their smaller invasion. I lived in the west and I have seen how your media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ No doubt you plan on exploiting helpless naive Americans for your own purposes. Hmm...let's see: Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that led to the invasion as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to be surprised not to know). It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid. What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis   over 200000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen if no western intervention happened and the second case was a direct or indirect result of western envolvement. Possibly if 200000 Iraqis had indeed died but this number is based on Greenpeace estimates.  Greenpeace had compromised its alleged impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental consequences of Allied miiltary action while initially *completely* ignoring Iraq's horrible environmental crimes starting with the dumping of millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of over 700 oil wells.  What is the real number?  There has been a lot of work on this in the last two years none of it reported as the Greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about.  The real number seems to be around 10000 on the same order as the number of Kuwaitis killed tortured and kidnapped during the occupation.  I've included an article I recently posted below but this is really old news.  Independent Television News reported a figure around 15000 only a few months after the war but it was hardly reported. For the Allies to have killed 200000 Iraqis they would have had to kill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait. The favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at Mutla'.  This was yet another example of the American and European media playing into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     The destruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla' was portrayed as an all-out slaughter.  This is simply not true.  The head and tail of the convoy was bombed initially resulting in a lot of casualties at these points. Before bombers came back most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled on foot. Furthermore your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn't invaded is completely ridiculous.  You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly) that Saddam is a barbarous brute.  You have acknowledged the hundreds of thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*. You *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait  Ali Majid was his most brutal henchman presiding over the near genocide of the Kurds  in the late 80's and more recently the Shi'a.    Yet when it comes to his treatment of Kuwaitis he is an angel.  In your estimate he would've killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started. What a joke! APn  03/09 0006  Iraq War Dead Copyright 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved. By NICK LUDINGTON Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Persian Gulf War ended the world was told that as many as 100000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. At one point even Baghdad put the toll that high as did the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in private. But U.S. officials have been backpedaling ever since even though the Pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public. Now one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed may have been as low as 1500. That conclusion by John Heidenrich writing in the current issue of the quarterly magazine Foreign Policy represents the lowest estimate yet from U.S. defense sources. The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of vastly moderated U.S. military claims in the months after the war ended. Claims for a number of U.S. weapons also were scaled down. Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking pictures of Iraq's disastrous retreat from Kuwait arguments have continued unabated about what really happened in the Gulf War. Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that originally were aired. More that a year ago Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles Horner the commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War said he believed the Iraqi military death toll was fewer than 10000 for the entire war. The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of Iraqis who died in the 42-day war against the U.S.-led coalition in January and February 1991. On Monday Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gradisher reiterated past statements that there just isn't a number that is credible. But some current internal estimates range from 8000 to 25000 Iraqi troops killed said one analyst speaking on condition of anonymity who is familiar with the Pentagon's reports. Allied deaths were put at 146 Americans 35 by friendly fire; 24 British 9 by American fire; 2 Frenchmen 1 Italian and 39 among various Arab allies. Of the postwar reassessments the most widely publicized was the Army's reluctant acknowledgement months later that its touted Patriot air defense system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq's Scud missiles. The Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the Patriot; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent. The success record of the Navy's Tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used against targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more modest than initially indicated by the Pentagon. The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a May 1991 report by the environmental group Greenpeace which said 100000 to 120000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. It estimated that 5000 to 15000 Iraqi civilians were also killed. The same month published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency estimated 100000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 300000 wounded in the air and ground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate could be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction. But as more information became available those figures gradually were revised downward. The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated 9000 dead and 17000 wounded after a review last year. But Heidenrich writing in the current issue of the quarterly Foreign Policy estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives as low as 1500 -- with about 3000 wounded. Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of bodies found and buried by U.S. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews. He noted that only about 2000 of 69000 Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded. Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were captured he put the number of wounded at about 3000. Using a conservative ratio of one dead to two wounded applicable to Third World armies like Iraq he set battlefield deaths at 1500. Maybe the figures are too low he wrote. Maybe the real death toll on the battlefield was 2000 or 3000 or even 6000. Even then the evidence suggests a death toll of well below 100000 -- or even 10000. In an interview he said the 100000 figure was obviously off base because it would mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of operations were casualties. He said today's bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology but rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia.

Shedding Some Light On September 29 1990 the National Council on US-Arab Relations invited the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the United States Saud Nasser Al-Sabah. The following are quotes of his speech: ``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before Iraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in existence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the area. Thereafter we signed with the British in 1899 a protective agreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security of Kuwait.'' ``In 1913 the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining without any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an agreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government and the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state after Kuwait itself.'' ``In 1961 when we declared our independence Iraq seized the opportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The British came in and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963 Kuwait and Iraq again signed border agreement thereby defining our territory and Iraq's recognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.'' ---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi Origins of Kuwait The establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the Bani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of Kuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go further up to 1611. Kuwait's name is derived from al-Kut which means fortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain which is the diminutive of qarn a horn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its establishment. The 'Utub al-Sabah family is a branch of 'Utub settled in Kuwait during the early 18th century. They lived under the protection of Bani Khalid until 1752. After that they became independent and Sabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub. Carsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who wrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific expedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He documented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf and in the case of Kuwait he was the first writer to give the two names by which the town was known Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr's chart of the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that century see the map from Abu Hakima History of Eastern Arabia 1750-1800. pub.1965. Al-Sabah ('Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern Arabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima's conclusions in his well documented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800 there was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of the 18th century there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. In fact Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their attempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the campaign of Thuwayni in 1786 and Ali Pasha's expedition against the Wahhabis in 1798 were unsuccessful. At Kuwait the nearest point of the Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra the Shaikh was under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of 'Utbi external policy was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the Gulf.'' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait was not a dependency of Basra the Persian occupation of Basra (1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.'' (p.183) Kuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab world. This identity was clear to the British and the French who tried to win the support of Kuwait's Sheikh between 1793-95 when the British wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the Gulf area. --- Independent Kuwait This is the first of a series of articles that testify to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans. The following text is related to an expedition carried out by the Ottomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields in Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir allied themselves with the Turks:} Abdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the expedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first to use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been for this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet Al-Qatif obviously would not have surrendered in a mere three hours. In relation to this a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships refrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of the progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area  the Sultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the war against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait which was not a party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861 was under no such obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against those who had signed it. [ From the above text we can see that Kuwait was not part of the Ottomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned expedition please check out the source of the above text: The Modern History of Kuwait 1750--1965 by Ahmed Abu-Hakima McGill University Canada ] --- Independent Kuwait--2 This is another article of a series of articles that testify to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans. The following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair Iraq between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. In 1866 trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the estate which was [purchased] by his father Sheikh Jabir in 1836. This property was sequestered by a Turkish Qa'immaqam [representative] on the basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the owner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time Sheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at the island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian territory. It should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start showed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn Sabah  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his father's agent in the case  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven years produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were entitled to receive. Eventually the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad in favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of Basra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. Some writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the Turkish side and suggest that the Governor Namiq Pasha even offered

2,From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Arab H.R. Assoc.Nazareth The Arab Association for Human Rights P.O. Box 215 Nazareth 16101 Israel Phone (972)-6-561923 Fax (972)-6-564934 The Arab Association for Human Rights (HRA) was formed in 1988 to address discriminatory practices and human rights abuses by Israel against its Palestinian citizens. It is a unique association concerned with the civil political economic social and cultural rights of the Palestinian national minority in Israel. Among the issues of concern are land confiscation education prison conditions unemployment torture and the unequal allocation of Israel's resources. Today there are around 800000 Palestinian Arabs living within the Green line (the pre-1967 borders of Israel) constituting 18% of Israel's citizens. For them it is an empty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the needs of the Jewish population. Legally and practically Israel has proclaimed itself a Jewish state and early promises of equality for non-Jewish citizens have not been fulfilled. This is apparent in many areas strongly affecting the Palestinian national minority. Most Arab agricultural land has been confiscated since 1948. The Arab sector is vastly underfunded and does not receive a fair share of state resources. On a day-to- day level Palestinians face discrimination in many different forms and find it is a struggle to get permission to build a house start a business find a job or educate their children. ACTIVITIES - Monitoring civil economic cultural and human rights abuses of Palestinians within the Green Line. - Taking carefully selected test cases to court. - Providing legal advice and assistance to lawyers in the Occupied Territories. - Educating the Palestinian public as to their rights and methods of mobilization. - Conducting public campaigns on local and international levels. - Researching and publishing pertinent publications.

Source: Hagop Hagopian said to have been part of 1972 Terror Attack at Munich Olympic Games The Armenian Reporter February 7 1985 p. 1. Le Matin the influential Paris daily based on unidentified sources claimed last week that Hagop Hagopian the founder and leader of one faction of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) was among the Arab terrorists who staged an attack on the living quarters of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games... Le Matin added that up to 1982 Hagopian operated out of Beirut Lebanon but escaped from the country when Israeli forces entered the city. It was about this time that a statement issued by ASALA claimed that Mr. Hagopian was dead of wounds suffered during a bombing by the Israeli Air Force although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and well and presently is residing alternately in Damascus Syria and Athens Greece. The paper also noted that the socialist government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his P.A.S.O.K. party accepted the Armenian underground leader with open arms and still providing him with assistance simply because of Greece's traditional enmity with Turkey. Le Matin further adds that ASALA derives only a small portion of its expenditures from wealthy Armenians who support the cause with the rest coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in drug trafficking.

Again where is your non-existent list of scholars and scholarly sources? Here is mine: An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in 1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound.

(Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - Preserving the Armenian purity) The crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination of the Muslim population in Soviet Republic of Armenia Karabag Bosnia and Herzegovina is an 'Islamic Holocaust' comparable to the extermination of 2.5 million Muslims by the Armenian Government during the WWI and of over 6 million European Jews during the WWII. (Tovfik Kasimov - Azeri Leader - September 25 1992) Today's ethnic cleansing policies by the Serbian dictatorship against Croatians and Muslims of Yugoslavia as well as the Soviet Republic of Armenia's against the Muslim population of neighboring Azerbaijan are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide perpetrated by the Armenian Government 78 years ago against the Turkish and Kurdish Muslims and Sephardic Jews living in these lands.

The Greeks started massacring the Turkish population on Cyprus in 1974. In 1974 Turkiye stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority. The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece someday whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios. The release of Nikos Sampson a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus committed murder to achieve this goal and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct. Turkish Cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a repeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the Greeks' EOKA. If such assurances are not perfectly implemented there is every reason to expect that the local Greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate their past mistakes. On such an occasion the Turkish side may not find it satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before for it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical vicious attacks. Therefore it would be better to have a true federation of two separate sections living in obligatory peace rather than another armed confrontation that would be started by the Greeks and obligatorily but decisively terminated by the Turks. The present Greek government is trying to tyrannize the Turkish population in western Thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights which were established through international treaties. One might be better advised to remember that misadventures against Turkiye do not serve Greece well. An offer of membership in the European Common Market as bait for concessions that may doom the Turks in Cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for Greece or her friends. Neither Turkish lives nor Turkish honor has been placed on the bidding block to be sold for commercial gain.

As Azerbaijan newspaper informs the issue of attraction of western investments in Azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. In particular Gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in the most profitable spheres of manufacture. He also noticed that the number of the priority manufactures will be released from debts. Guliyev also said that intensifying the activities of the American oil companies will promote the strengthening of the American-Azeri relations. THE PROPOSAL TO SUMMON SPECIAL SESSION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET IS REJECTED AGAIN Baku (May 19) Turan: Yesterday in the sitting of the Milli Mejlis the chairman Isa Gambar rejected the proposal of the deputy Arif Rahimzade to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan. This written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates. But the chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't be submitted for discussion. Earlier the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy for the Parliament Rahimzade doesn't consider that the deputates have the objective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns the serious analysis of the social economic and foreign policy activity of the republic's authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion on these questions. The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago when it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power. The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis consisting of 50 deputates (25 democrats and 25 partocrates). At that time democrats and partocrates came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn't exist for a long time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon a session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity out of the Parliament. --0-- THE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreement between Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign Minister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics Minister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18. The group of experts is headed by Tikht Reiman the chief of the Ministry of Economics of Estonia. The MIA of Azerbaijan informed Turan agency that in their stay in Baku the delegation will also visit Ministry of Economics and National Bank of the republic.--0-- AZERBAIJAN DOES NOT INTEND TO JOIN THE CIS COMMON ECONOMIC ZONE Baku (May 19) Turan: Deputy prime-ministers of the republic Vahid Ahmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan wouldn't join the CIS common economic zone. Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic. According to Abbas Abbasov the pact of cooperation proposals submitted for the discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14 has a number of unfavorable points for Azerbaijan. Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the background of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of the Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic zone.--0-- THE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW Baku (May 19) Turan: Today Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director of the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republic along with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow to hold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan. According to the preliminary information the credit will be 50 billion rubles. As press-centre of Ministry of Finance informed Turan's correspondent precise amount of the credit conditions of its repay and a number of other questions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in Moscow. It is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling of industrial enterprises of Azerbaijan and Russia. When the sides reach the agreement it is proposed for signing by the end of May.--0-- AZERBAIJAN WILL REPLY TO THE SECOND VARIANT OF TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BY 26 OF MAY Baku (May 19) Turan: On the measures for peace presented by Russia Turkey and the USA to Azerbaijan and Armenia the representative of the president of Azerbaijan in the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh Asim Gasimov noted that the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant. Just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by insistence of the Armenian side. We do not intend to come back to the analysis of the schedule because we have given a positive answer to it on May 6- said Gasimov. The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just began to work on the examination of the commentary and their answer would be given as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 26. As it is known the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by Armenia which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0-- THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The Azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced that the Russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 Russian soldiers condemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court as innocent people is unjustified. Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves prove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit where they served. The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also unfounded. For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the list of one of the military unit's of Russian commandos in Yerevan. Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of the Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the Russian community. Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows that this type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0-- AZERBAIJAN'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE SIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed parliament of Azerbaijan is considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six accused soldiers' fortune. In particular the offer to send the representatives of the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation to Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers' case will be directed to Russian parliament. According to one of the supporters of this offer such initiative will give Russian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the investigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have given rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation in the war against Azerbaijan. ARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE KARABAKHS ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of Armenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies on the territories of Rostov Stavropol and Krasnodar regions - reported the newspaper Russky vestnik on March 9 1993 published in Geneva. The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the documents of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of reunion of the North Caucasus and Armenia proper at present the front is appealing to the UN presidents of Russia Armenia and the United States to consider the need to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus. To attain these goals the Armenian organization considers it necessary to carry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity identical to those in Nagorno Karabakh. Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian national-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of Armenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus instructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted. Thus according to the newspaper Russky vestnik new Karabakhs are being planning on the North Caucasus. --O-- STATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary of Azerbaijan Ali Kerimov with the participation of the national cultural centers was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the president Elchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and culture of national minorities adopted on September 16 1992 were considered. The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a legal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership of Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected. The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy Hidayat Orujev announced that in spite of the difficulties of the undeclared war against the republic the leaders of the state managed to solve many problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic groups. For today all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation furniture and means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign diplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of free accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary). As it was noted a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted to create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North of Azerbaijan where Lezghins live a national Lezghin theater was opened radiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of the educational literature for Talyshs Tats Lezghins and Kurds and national teaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan.--O-- MEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State concern Azerineft the Memorandum of understanding with the companies AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum Bi-Pi Exploration Operating Pennzoil Caspian Unocal Khazar Ltd. McDermott and Turkish oil corporation on mutual extracting of fields Azeri Chirag and Gyuneshli was signed. According to the memorandum the general group on preparing of a common program of activity was created. According to the president of Azerineft Sabit Bagirov cooperation will provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently. During the project the main principles will be the effective use of oil-gas resources the rational sharing of investments the reducing of exploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the exploitation of these fields. The memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical and political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas fields. --O-- ARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS BAKU (MAY 21)

Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity: Turkiye Greece and Chile are in the same category. That is $3000 - $5999. Source: 'International Economics: Theory and Policy' by Paul R. Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld Harper Collins Publishers 1991 (second edition). In terms of 'Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity' Greece is in the same category with Turkiye. Indeed Greek Governments have enormous problems to tackle. The economy is in shambles corruption is rampant air pollution is in outrageous dimensions state-sponsored terrorism is the name of the game and infrastructure is decaying. Another insightful article in the New York Times (Sunday April 7) exposes the dirty linen of Greece and describes her as the pariah of the European Community. The article reports that ''...with un-European antics Greece uses the Community as a cash register. She squanders and at times even steals the European tax payers' money for political featherbedding at home. The principal members of the Community admit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the European Community.'' This affirmation is testimony to the fact that notwithstanding her geographic location Greece is un-European in mentality and attitude. Indeed during the last 12 years Turkiye registered a great success with regard to economic restructuring. A sound economy ready to be integrated to the world economies has emerged succeeding to the faltering one witnessed in the '70s. Just 12 years ago Greece used to export double as much as Turkiye did. Now inversely Turkiye's overall exports exceed by far that of Greece. As far as the tourism incomes are concerned we are witnessing the same phenomenon. The governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on the infrastructure investments (rather than investing in world terrorist organizations) thereby solving this issue completely. Indeed in the '70s it was out of the question to conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West. Nowadays this is not the case at all and in a far remote town even in a village you may have at any time a long-distance call to any given country. However the same could not be applied to Greece. In fact it is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany round the clock. And if you happen to be in the Greek islands then your chance will be pretty slim. Therefore it would not be an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of Greece in regard to telecommunication facilities. Greece by virtue of its full membership has enjoyed all advantages of the EC obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies. Turkiye having no access at all to similar financial supports has nevertheless managed to create a better economy which enabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus over the last two years. As such Turkiye deserves to be the only country in its region having permanent current accounts surplus.

Apparently there is a new documentary about him and his concepts on the propagandist news media of the West or some such.

Nope Serdar I don't think so. > As for the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people between > 1914 and 1920: > Oops you almost forgot to fill in the Say something about Turks being killed by Armenians here section of your note. > Serdar Argic Yeah sure you are really Serdar Argic and I am really BOB HOPE!!!!  So you may have ALREADY won 10 MILLION DOLLARS!!!  Unfortunately for you the Armenian Foundation in Istambul is SURE to steal it from you on the subway and then give it to terrorists to kill innocent Kurds and innocent Israeli athletes.  Ahhh when are you going to take me to this fantasy world of yours??
2,Well everybody After reading tons of notes by Serdar I have come to the following conclusion. Turkey is PERFECT and no Turk has ever made a mistake.  He has proved to me at least that the land occupied by Turkey today was ALWAYS lived in peacefully by Turks.  (Including Istanbul AKA Constantinople)  They treat their minorities like gods and have only done good while all of their evil neighbors attacked them.  Somehow despite these evil neighbors capable of nothing but murder their population has exploded to almost 60 million in Turkey alone. (Note Armenian worldwide population is approximately 7 million total)  I want to go to this heaven on earth and meet the race that has made Serdar possible that has persevered and has become a mecca for human rights lovers.  (Amnesty International must have bad sources Turkey would never torture its citizens treat minorities badly or kidnap 7 foreign journalists last year alone who incidentally are still missing) what I am trying to say is I WANT TO BE A TURK!!!! Now back to reality.  I have once again been astounded by Serdars ability to ignore all truth all truly difficult questions and go on to his encyclopedia of quotes and sources that can be pasted into any note BY THE PAGE!  Anybody at all who has believed ANYTHING he has said please step forward.  Let him know he hasn't been wasting his time that SOMEBODY out there can be convinced by the volume of e-mail you can produce not the quality of the content. Well I am off now.  I will go dream  some more about that perfect place that nirvana that utopia that xanadu that TURKEY! n_w$$h

Source: Ahmet Cosar said to have been part of 1992 Terror Attack at MacDonalds in Munich The Fuckersville Reporter February 7 1993 p. 1. Le Merde the influential Anatolia daily based on unidentified sources claimed last week that Ahmet Cosar the founder and leader of one faction of the Big Mac Funny Army for the Liberation of Flies from the Spider Webs (BMFALFSW) was among the Argic led terrorists who staged an attack on the toilets at MacDonalds fast food restaurant in Munich... Le Merde added that up to 1992 Cosar operated out of tygra.michigan.com but escaped from the country when Bullshit bikers entered the city. It was about this time that a statement issued by BMFALFSW claimed that Mr. Cosar was dead of wounds suffered during a mailbombing by bdb@becker.gts.org although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and well and presently is residing alternately in Fuckersville Bullshitia and Zuma Stupidia. The paper also noted that the communist government of Sexual Maniac Hasan B. Mutlu and his F.U.C.K.A.L.L party accepted the Zumabot's underground leader with open arms and still providing him with assistance in exchange for pornographic material. Le Merde further adds that BMFALFSW derives only a small portion of its expenditures from wealthy drug lords who support the cause with the rest coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in child-porn trafficking.

2,Lovely arguments.  But do we write about historical ownership of any place - Palestine Pakistan Cyprus Aegean Islands (and the oil that may lie beneath them) whatever - for any reason other than justification for stomping others? DOES IT TRULY MATTER whose ancestor lived where 20 200 or 2000 years ago?  More than how you treat the land and each other? Who is wise enough to decree that a person's right to life liberty and pursuit of happiness in a particular place depends on accidents of birth?  Who can even be sure about the precise tracks of the sperm that birthed the people we wish to despise? IMHO the American Indians have it right.  We belong to the earth it does not belong to us.  Failure to understand that is a good way to cause lossage all the way around.  My guess is that once we trash our environment sufficiently we shall die along with it - the baby eating and killing its mother then dying for lack of milk. Death and disease do not respect national boundaries not as toxins disease vectors  lost farmland/wetlands/forest cover/water supplies nor any other way.  When we fight over which national group owns which piece of turf we are merely contending for the best vantage point from which to kill others our land and eventually ourselves. That is something of which to be proud.  Very proud.  Makes me glad to be human. I'm not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism.  Maybe it's fair to ask whether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure that all _my_ ancestors (hah!) labored to produce.  But it's an artificial distinction: is the recent immigrant even a refugee less likely to contribute to the next generation's legacy than anyone else?  [In history the reverse is often the case: recent immigrants strive hardest.  If nothing else they fill open eco(l/n)ogic niches.] Then again my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe so I can understand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off.  While I of course will make sure it doesn't happen even if I must shoot Muslim infants (or bash Jewish ones against the walls of schoolhouses) to do so.  That'll prove my moral superiority by golly as well as the rightness of my cause. Clearly there is no higher purpose in life than killing others because they are not like you.  I would never get in the way of such fun. Let's see: soc.culture.turkish - Why don't you Turks go back to Lake Baikal where you came from and leave the land to the Greeks who stole it fair and square from the Scythians? soc.culture.pakistan - Why don't you guys redistribute yourselves over India as God meant for you to do? soc.culture.jewish soc.culture.arabic - we stick together fight together die together.  We are brothers and inseparable. talk.politics.mideast - oh well had to be there. Oded [Planning on being a Scythian irredentist as soon as I finish my present assignment.] P.S.:	I can't get a semi-decent death threat anymore? P.P.S.:	Yeh the Native Americans had it right.  We had to kill them off to keep their sedition from spreading.

[IC] In fact there are some areas where Armenians are majority. [IC] Suppose a large group of people of one of such area decides [IC] that the US government is not representing their interests and vote for [IC] seperation from the USA. The Armenians you refer to have chosen to come to the United States lawfully and peacefully. However if Armenians invade the United States and force Americans to either flee or become Armenians it will not succeed. Similarly the Armenians of Karabakh are being forced by Azerbaijan to either become Azeris or leave and it also will not succeed as has been demonstrated. Karabakh irrespective of its geographic position situated technically within the Stalin-prepared borders of Azerbaijan has been long oppressed and eventually was invaded in 1991 by Azeri OMON and Soviet forces resulting in the northern third of this Armenian area being depopulated of Armenians. The Armenians have been fighting back ever since. Clearly you feel it rather ridiculous for Armenians of let's say Glendale California to engage in an independence movement for a free and independent Glendale. Similarly the Azerbaijanis are engaging in a losing attempt at claiming sovereignty over the land and people of Karabakh who have lived continuously in Karabakh a thousand years before the first Central Asian invaders ever stepped foot in the Caucasus. [IC] Should they get it? [IC] And should the UN enforce their will? [IC] And is it a simple beautiful concept indeed? Your analogy has broken down because you have switched positions of the victim and invader. A better analogy would be the direct parallel between Armenians of Karabakh and Native Americans.
